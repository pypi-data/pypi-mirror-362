*pyrsgis* enables the user to read, process and export GeoTIFFs. The module is built on the GDAL library but is much more convenient when it comes to reading and exporting GeoTIFs. There are several other functions available in this package that ease raster pre-processing.<br/>

A list of available functions and sample code are available on the [documentation page](https://pyrsgis.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html).<br/>

Feedback and bug reports are most welcome. Since this is an open-source project, I always look forward to contributors. You can write to me at [pratkrt@gmail.com](mailto:pratkrt@gmail.com).

pyrsgis is available on both, PyPI and Anaconda. Please check the [installation page](https://pyrsgis.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html) for details.
