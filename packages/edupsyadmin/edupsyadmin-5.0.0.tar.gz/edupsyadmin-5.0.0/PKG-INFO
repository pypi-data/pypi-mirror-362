# edupsyadmin

edupsyadmin provides tools to help school psychologists with their
documentation

## Basic Setup

You can install the CLI using pip or
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).

Install with uv:

    $ uv tool install edupsyadmin

You may get a warning that the `bin` directory is not on your environment path.
If that is the case, copy the path from the warning and add it directory to
your **environment path** permanently or just for the current session.

Run the application:

    $ edupsyadmin --help

## Getting started

### Modify the config file

First, you have to update the config file with your data. To
find the config file, run:

`edupsyadmin info`

In the output, you will see your `config_path`. Open the file
using an editor that does not add formatting (for example
Notepad on Windows). Change all values to the data that you
want to appear in your documentation:

1. First replace YOUR.USER.NAME with your user name (no spaces and no special
   characters):

   `  app_username: YOUR.USER.NAME`

2. Then change your data under `schoolpsy`

  ```
    schoolpsy_name: "Write out your name here"
    schoolpsy_street: "Your street and house number"
    schoolpsy_town: "Postecode and town"
  ```

3. Under `school`, change the short name for your school to something more
   memorable than `FirstSchool`. Do not use spaces or special characters:

   `  MyMemorableSchoolName:`

4. Add the data for your school. The `end` variable will be used to estimate
   the date for the destruction of records (3 years after the estimated
   graduation date).

  ```
    school_head_w_school: "Title of your head of school"
    school_name: "Name of your school written out"
    school_street: "Street and house number of your school"
    school_town: "Postecode and town"
    end: 11
  ```

5. Reapeat step 3 and 4 for each school you work at.

6. Change the paths under filesets to point to the (sets of) files you want to
   use.

  ```
  form_set:
    name_of_my_form_set:
      - "path/to/my/first_file.pdf"
      - "path/to/my/second_file.pdf"
  ```

### Storing credentials

edupsyadmin uses `keyring` for the encryption credentials. `keyring` has
several backends.

- On Windows the default is the Windows Credential Manager (German:
  Anmeldeinformationsverwaltung).

- On macOS, the default is Keychain (German: Schl√ºsselbund)

For the keychain backend you want to use, add an entry using the username from
your config.yaml.

- Internet or network address: `liebermann-schulpsychologie.github.io`
- User name: `the_user_name_from_your_config_file`
- Password: `a_secure_password`

## The database

The information you enter, is stored in an SQLite database with the fields
described [in the documentation for
edupsyadmin](https://edupsyadmin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clients_model.html#)

## Examples

Get information about the path to the config file and the path to the database:

    $ edupsyadmin info

Add a client interactively:

    $ edupsyadmin new_client

Add a client to the database from a Webuntis csv export:

    $ edupsyadmin new_client --csv ./path/to/your/file.csv --name "short_name_of_client"

Change values for the database entry with `client_id=42`:

```
$ edupsyadmin set_client 2 \
  "nta_font=1" \
  "nta_zeitverl_vieltext=20" \
  "nos_rs=0" \
  "lrst_diagnosis=iLst"
```

See an overview of all clients in the database:

    $ edupsyadmin get_clients

Fill a PDF form for the database entry with `client_id=42`:

    $ edupsyadmin create_documentation 42 ./path/to/your/file.pdf

Fill all files that belong to the form_set `lrst` (as defined in the
config.yml) with the data for `client_id=42`:

    $ edupsyadmin create_documentation 42 --form_set lrst

## Development

Create the development enviroment:

    $ uv v
    $ uv pip install -e .

Run the test suite:

    $ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -v -n auto --cov=src test/

Build documentation:

    $ .venv/bin/python -m sphinx -M html docs docs/_build
