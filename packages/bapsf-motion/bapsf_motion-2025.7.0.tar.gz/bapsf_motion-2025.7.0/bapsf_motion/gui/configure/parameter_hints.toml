# This TOML file contains the hints used to populate the placeholder text
# for input fields associated with configuring layers, exlusions, and
# transforms.
#
# Adding any hints should folow the pattern:
#
# [hints.<entity>.<type>]
# param1 = "placeholder text"
# param2 = "placeholder text"
#
# where,
#   <entity> :
#       is the layer, exclusion, or transform
#   <type> :
#       is the "type" of <entity> class.  e.g. the transform LaPDXYTransform
#       has <type> == lapd_xy, and exclusion CircularLayer has
#       <type> == circle
#   param1, param2, ... :
#       are the input arguments for the class being configurated,  e.g.
#       CircularExlusion would have param1 == radius, param2 == center,
#       and param3 == exlude
#
#       Note that not all input parameters need configured.  You only
#       need to configure input you want to add placeholder test for.
