ASTMIO

`astmio` is a Python library designed to handle ASTM communication protocols used in medical and laboratory equipment. It provides tools to parse, build, and transmit ASTM E1381/E1394 messages over serial connections, making it easy to integrate lab machines like blood analyzers with custom Laboratory Information Systems (LIS).

## Features

*   Full support for ASTM message parsing and encoding
*   Serial port abstraction for easy device communication
*   Customizable message mapping and field-level access
*   Built with extensibility in mind for LIS and middleware integration
