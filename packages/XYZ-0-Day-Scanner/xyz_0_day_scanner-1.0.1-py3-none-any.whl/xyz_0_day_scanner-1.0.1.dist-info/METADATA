## üöÄ Overview

The XYZ 0-Day Scanner is a powerful command-line interface that allows developers and security professionals to scan their projects for known vulnerabilities. It leverages the comprehensive XYZ Vulnerability Database to provide real-time security insights.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan your projects for vulnerabilities using a variety of methods.
-   **Package Auditing**: Audit your dependencies for known security issues.
-   **Exploit Information**: Get information about known exploits for discovered vulnerabilities.
-   **Multi-Ecosystem Support**: Scan projects in various ecosystems, including Python and Go.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the XYZ 0-Day Scanner using `pip` or `uv`:

```bash
pip install XYZ-0-Day-Scanner
```

or

```bash
uv pip install XYZ-0-Day-Scanner
```

**Note:** To use the Go auditing features, you will also need to install `depsdev`:

```bash
go install github.com/edoardottt/depsdev/cmd/depsdev@latest
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

To get started, you'll need to log in to your CyberXYZ account:

```bash
xyz login
```

Once logged in, you can use the following commands to check your projects for vulnerabilities.

### `info`

```bash
xyz info
```

### `vuln`

Search for a specific vulnerability by ID (e.g., CVE, GHSA).

```bash
xyz vuln CVE-2021-44228
```

**Options:**

*   `-x`, `--exploits`: Include exploit information.
*   `--affected`: Show affected packages.
*   `--json`: Output as JSON.

### `package`

Search for vulnerabilities affecting a specific package.

```bash
xyz package requests -e pypi -v 2.25.1
```

**Options:**

*   `-e`, `--ecosystem`: Filter by ecosystem (e.g., npm, pypi, maven).
*   `-v`, `--version`: Filter by package version.
*   `-s`, `--severity`: Filter by severity (critical, high, medium, low).
*   `-x`, `--exploits`: Include exploit information.
*   `--limit`: Maximum results to return.
