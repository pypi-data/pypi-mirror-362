## Credits

Thanks to [knyazer](https://github.com/knyazer) and
[patrick-kidger](https://github.com/patrick-kidger) for building the `jaxtyping`
IPython extension, which was used as the base for this extension.

Also special thanks to [leycec](https://github.com/leycec) for creating beartype
and the IPython team.
