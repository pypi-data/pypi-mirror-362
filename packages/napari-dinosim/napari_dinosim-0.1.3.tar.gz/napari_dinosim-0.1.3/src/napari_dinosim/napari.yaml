  This plugin uses DINOSim, a method that leverages the DINOv2 foundation model
  for zero-shot object detection and segmentation in bioimage analysis.
  DINOSim uses pretrained DINOv2 embeddings to compare patch similarities,
  allowing it to detect and segment unseen objects in complex datasets with minimal annotations.
