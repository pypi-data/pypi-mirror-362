# ShitLint 💩🔍

**Your code is shit. Here's why.**

ShitLint is the AI code reviewer that cuts through the fluff and calls out the architectural dumpster fires hiding in your codebase. No sugar, no fluff — just the cold, hard truth.

## Why ShitLint Exists

Ever wonder why your "simple feature" took 3 weeks to implement? It's because your code is a tangled mess of:
- Copy-pasted functions everywhere (DRY? Never heard of it)
- 200+ line files of spaghetti bullshit
- Abstractions that abstract nothing
- Imports that look like some shat on your keyboard

Traditional linters catch typos. ShitLint catches **architectural bullshit**.

## What ShitLint Actually Does

```bash
$ shitlint .
```

```
⏺ FLAGGED BULLSHIT:

🚨 DRY VIOLATION:
- user_service.py:45-67 and admin_service.py:12-34 are literally the same function
- Did you copy-paste this? Be honest.

🚨 GIANT FILE ALERT:
- database.py:847 lines - This isn't a file, it's a novel
- Split this monstrosity before it gains sentience

🚨 BULLSHIT ABSTRACTION:
- utils.py:23 - A function called "doStuff" that does 47 different things
- Name your functions like a human, not a caffeinated squirrel

🚨 IMPORT CEREMONY:
- 23 imports for a 15-line file
- This isn't dependency injection, it's dependency addiction

VERDICT: Your code looks like it was written during a earthquake
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g shitlint
# or
pip install shitlint
# or just clone this repo and suffer with the rest of us
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
shitlint .

# Scan specific file
shitlint path/to/your/disaster.py

# Get roasted in real-time
shitlint --watch ./src

# Extra brutal mode (not recommended for sensitive developers)
shitlint --brutal ./src
```

## Configuration

Create a `.shitlint.json` file to customize how brutally honest you want the feedback:

```json
{
  "brutality": "gordon-ramsay",
  "roast_level": "professional-chef",
  "ignore_patterns": ["legacy/*", "vendor/*"],
  "custom_insults": true
}
```

## Language Support

- Python ✅ (your FastAPI spaghetti)
- JavaScript ✅ (your React component soup)
- TypeScript ✅ (your over-engineered type gymnastics)
- Go ✅ (your "simple" microservice that imports 47 packages)
- More languages coming (unfortunately)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just a joke?**
A: No. Your code genuinely needs help.

**Q: Why so aggressive?**
A: Because your linter has been lying to you. Someone has to tell the truth.

**Q: Can I disable the roasting?**
A: You can, but then you're just running a regular linter. Where's the fun in that?

**Q: Will this hurt my feelings?**
A: Probably. But your code will be better for it.

## Contributing

Found a new way code can be terrible? We'd love to hear about it.

1. Fork this repo
2. Add your horror stories to the detection engine
3. Submit a PR
4. Watch other developers suffer

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integration with popular IDEs (so you can be roasted in real-time)
- [ ] Team dashboard (shame your colleagues publicly)
- [ ] AI-generated refactoring suggestions (because apparently you need help)
- [ ] Slack integration (get roasted in meetings)
- [ ] Custom personality modes (Gordon Ramsay, Disappointed Parent, etc.)

## License

MIT - Because even terrible code deserves freedom
