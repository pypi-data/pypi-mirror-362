# django-queryhunter
Hunt down the lines of your Django application code which are responsible for executing the most queries.

Libraries such as [django-silk](https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk) are excellent for profiling the queries 
executed by your Django application. We have found, however, that they do not provide a completely straightforward
way to identify the lines of your **application** code which are responsible for executing the most queries.
This library aims to fill that gap by providing a simple code-first approach to query profiling. 

One particularly useful feature of this view of profiling is quickly identifying missing `select_related` and `prefetch_related` calls.

## Highlights

- Context manager and middleware for profiling queries which can provide a detailed report of the lines of your 
  application code which are responsible for executing SQL queries, including data on:
  - The module name and the line number of the code which executed the query.
  - The executing code itself on that line.
  - The number queries that line was responsible for invoking was and the total time the queries invoked
    by that line took to execute.
  - The SQL query itself. Note that we only display the _last_ SQL query executed on that line.
  - Customisable metadata such as the URL and method of the request which caused the queries to be executed.
- Configurable options for filtering, sorting, printing or logging the results.
- Lightweight: `queryhunter` uses Django's [database hooks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/instrumentation/)
  and the built-in `linecache` module to provide a simple and efficient way to map SQL queries to the lines of your
  application code which executed them.

Here is some sample output:

```bash
queryhunter/tests/my_module.py
====================================
Line no: 13 | Code: for post in posts: | Num. Queries: 1 | SQL: SELECT "tests_post"."id", "tests_post"."content", "tests_post"."author_id" FROM "tests_post" | Duration: 4.783299999999713e-05
Line no: 14 | Code: authors.append(post.author.name) | Num. Queries: 5 | SQL: SELECT "tests_author"."id", "tests_author"."name" FROM "tests_author" WHERE "tests_author"."id" = %s LIMIT 21 | Duration: 8.804199999801199e-05
```

## Usage in Production

*queryhunter* is lightweight enough to have enabled in production and 
its profiling will have negligible effect on performance. Having it 
continually enabled in production means we can use it as a monitoring tool, 
quickly alerting the developer to any new bottlenecks accidentally introduced.

We have used this on a production code base and environment and it
has outperformed similar libraries in diagnosing certain kinds of performance issues.
We have found that it is adept in identifying missing `select_related` and `prefetch_related` calls in production code. 

## Installation
```bash
pip install django-queryhunter
```

You must then declare the `QUERYHUNTER_BASE_DIR` setting in your settings.py file. This is 
the way that queryhunter knows where to look for your application code (or rather, the point in the stack
at which to report as being responsible for executing a query).

You can use the built-in callable `queryhunter.default_base_dir` to set it to be the project root or 
make it a string of your choosing.

```python
import queryhunter

QUERYHUNTER_BASE_DIR = queryhunter.default_base_dir(__file__)
```

## Usage via Example

Let's suppose we have a Django application with the following models (a fully functional example can be found in the
`queryhunter.tests` directory):

```python
# queryhunter/tests/models.py
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    content = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

Now suppose we have another module my_module.py where we fetch our posts and collect their author's names
in a list. We run this code under the `queryhunter` context manager, which will collect information on the
lines of code responsible for executing SQL queries inside the context:

```python
# queryhunter/tests/my_module.py
from queryhunter.tests.models import Post, Author
from queryhunter import queryhunter

def get_authors() -> list[Author]:
    with queryhunter():
        authors = []
        posts = Post.objects.all()  # suppose we have 5 posts
        for post in posts:
            authors.append(post.author.name)
    return authors
```

Let's now run the code

```python
>>> from queryhunter.tests.my_module import get_authors
>>> get_authors()
```
and see what the output from the queryhunter is:

```bash
queryhunter/tests/my_module.py
====================================
Line no: 8 | Code: for post in posts: | Num. Queries: 1 | SQL: SELECT "tests_post"."id", "tests_post"."content", "tests_post"."author_id" FROM "tests_post" | Duration: 4.783299999999713e-05
Line no: 9 | Code: authors.append(post.author.name) | Num. Queries: 5 | SQL: SELECT "tests_author"."id", "tests_author"."name" FROM "tests_author" WHERE "tests_author"."id" = %s LIMIT 21 | Duration: 8.804199999801199e-05
```
What can we learn from this output?

- There are 2 distinct lines of code responsible for executing SQL in the get_authors function.
- The line `authors.append(post.author.name)` was responsible for executing 5 SQL queries, one for each post. 
- This is a quick way to identify that we are missing a `select_related('author')` call in our 
  `Post.objects.all()` query.

This may have been obvious in this contrived example, but in a large code base, flushing out these kinds of issues can be very useful.
Additional custom data can be added to the output as explained below in the [Reporting Options](#reporting-options) 
section.


## Middleware

**queryhunter** also ships with a middleware which, when installed, will profile all requests to your Django application.
To install the middleware, add `queryhunter.middleware.QueryHunterMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting:
```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'queryhunter.middleware.QueryHunterMiddleware',
]
```
Under the hood, the middleware will run all requests under the `queryhunter.queryhunter` context manager.
As well as the usual query data reported by queryhunter, the middleware will also report the URL and the method of the request
which caused the queries to be executed. Here's some sample output:


```bash
queryhunter/tests/my_module.py
====================================
Line no: 8 | Code: for post in posts: | Num. Queries: 1 | Duration: 0.04 | url: /authors | method: GET | SQL: SELECT "tests_post"."id", "tests_post"."content", "tests_post"."author_id" FROM "tests_post"
Line no: 9 | Code: authors.append(post.author.name) | Num. Queries: 5 | Duration: 0.05 | url: /authors | method: GET | SQL: SELECT "tests_author"."id", "tests_author"."name" FROM "tests_author" WHERE "tests_author"."id" = %s LIMIT 21
```


## Reporting Options

**queryhunter** can be configured with a number of options which dictate the way the profiling data is reported and displayed. 
We can declare the options globally via the `QUERYHUNTER_REPORTING_OPTIONS` setting in our `settings.py` file, or we can 
pass reporting options more granularly to the `queryhunter` context manager. 

In either case, options are declared as an instance of either the `PrintingOptions` class or the 
`LoggingOptions` class.


By default, reporting will be based on the default values of `PrintingOptions`.
If for example you wanted to set it so that your output is always so that the lines of code which execute the most queries
are printed first, you would declare the following in your `settings.py` file:

```python
# settings.py
from queryhunter import PrintingOptions

QUERYHUNTER_REPORTING_OPTIONS = PrintingOptions(sort_by='-count')
```

or, alternatively, you could pass the instance into a specific context manager:

```python
from queryhunter import queryhunter, PrintingOptions

with queryhunter(reporting_options=PrintingOptions(sort_by='-count')):
    ...
```

If a context manager uses an explicit instance of `PrintingOptions` or `LoggingOptions`,
it will override the global `QUERYHUNTER_REPORTING_OPTIONS` setting.


### PrintingOptions

Use the `PrintingOptions` class if you want to print the profiling results to the console.
`PrintingOptions` class can be configured via the attributes below:

- `sort_by`: A string valued property which determines the order in which each line of code is printed
   for each module profiled. Options are `line_no, -line_no, count, -count, duration, -duration`.
   The default is `line_no`.
- `modules`: An optional list of strings which can be used to filter the modules which are profiled. 
   The default is `None`, which means all modules touched within the context are profiled.
- `max_sql_length`: An optional integer valued property which determines the maximum length of the SQL query printed.
   The default is None, meaning the entire SQL query is printed.
- `count_highlighting_threshold`: An integer valued property which determines the threshold for the number of 
   queries executed on a line of code before it is highlighted red in the output. The default is 5.
- `duration_highlighting_threshold`: A float valued property which determines the threshold for the no. of seconds
   a line of code can spend executing before it is highlighted red in the output. The default is 0.1.
- `count_threshold`: An integer valued property which determines the threshold for the number of 
   queries executed on a line of code before it is printed. The default is 1.
- `duration_threshold`: A float valued property which determines the threshold for the no. of seconds
   a line of code can spend executing before it is printed. The default is 0.0.


### LoggingOptions

Use the `LoggingOptions` class if you want to log the profiling results to a file. 
`LoggingOptions` class can be configured via the attributes below:

- `logger_name`: A string valued property which determines the name of the logger which will be used to log the output.
   The default is `queryhunter`.
- `sort_by`: A string valued property which determines the order in which each line of code is printed
   for each module profiled. Options are `line_no, -line_no, count, -count, duration, -duration`.
   The default is `line_no`.
- `modules`: An optional list of strings which can be used to filter the modules which are profiled. 
   The default is `None`, which means all modules touched within the context are profiled.
- `max_sql_length`: An optional integer valued property which determines the maximum length of the SQL query printed.
   The default is None, meaning the entire SQL query is printed.
- `count_threshold`: An integer valued property which determines the threshold for the number of 
   queries executed on a line of code before it is logged. The default is 1.
- `duration_threshold`: A float valued property which determines the threshold for the no. of seconds
   a line of code can spend executing before it is logged. The default is 0.0.


Logging is compatible with the standard Python logging library and its [Django extension](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/logging/).
For example, to have **queryhunter** log to a file called `queryhunter.log`, we can add the following to our `settings.py` file:

```python
QUERYHUNTER_REPORTING_OPTIONS = LoggingOptions(logger_name='queryhunter', sort_by='-count')

LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'formatters': {
        'standard': {
            'format': '%(asctime)s - %(message)s'
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'queryhunter_file': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
            'filename': QUERYHUNTER_BASE_DIR + '/queryhunter.log',
            'formatter': 'standard',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        QUERYHUNTER_REPORTING_OPTIONS.logger_name: {
            'handlers': ['queryhunter_file'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    },
}

```

This will produce a log file `queryhunter.log` which has content like below:

```bash
2024-02-18 07:04:16,182 - Module: django-queryhunter/queryhunter/tests/my_module.py | Line no: 14 | Code: authors.append(post.author.name) | Num. Queries: 5 | SQL: SELECT "tests_author"."id", "tests_author"."name" FROM "tests_author" WHERE "tests_author"."id" = %s LIMIT 21 | Duration: 3.174999999999706e-05 | url: /authors/ | method: GET
2024-02-18 07:04:16,182 - Module: django-queryhunter/queryhunter/tests/my_module.py | Line no: 13 | Code: for post in posts: | Num. Queries: 1 | SQL: SELECT "tests_post"."id", "tests_post"."content", "tests_post"."author_id" FROM "tests_post" | Duration: 1.2500000000026379e-05 | url: /authors/ | method: GET
```


### RaisingOptions

Use the `RaisingOptions` class if you want *queryhunter* to raise an exception when a bad query is found. `RaisingOptions` class can be configured via the attributes below:

- `sort_by`: A string valued property which determines the order in which each line of code is printed
   for each module profiled. Options are `line_no, -line_no, count, -count, duration, -duration`.
   The default is `line_no`.
- `modules`: An optional list of strings which can be used to filter the modules which are profiled. 
   The default is `None`, which means all modules touched within the context are profiled.
- `max_sql_length`: An optional integer valued property which determines the maximum length of the SQL query printed.
   The default is None, meaning the entire SQL query is printed.
- `count_threshold`: An integer valued property which determines the threshold for the number of 
   queries executed on a line of code before an exception is raised. The default is 1.
- `duration_threshold`: A float valued property which determines the threshold for the no. of seconds
   a line of code can spend executing before an exception is raised. The default is 0.5.

> [!WARNING]
> Setting `RaisingOptions` can be quite useful for testing, since it causes tests with slow/repeating queries to fail. *You should not use `RaisingOptions` in production.*


## Custom Metadata

You can add custom metadata to queryhunter's output by passing in the `metadata` argument to the 
`queryhunter` context manager. In fact, this is precisely what the middleware does to add the 
URL and method of the request:
    
```python
from queryhunter import queryhunter

with queryhunter(meta_data=dict(url=request.path, method=request.method)):
    ...
```

Adding custom meta data can be particularly useful when you want to associate an 
identifier with the profiling data.


## Profiling Third Party Code
Note that the primary aim of queryhunter is to identify the lines of your application code which result in SQL queries.
It can however be configured to profile third party code with the appropriate choice of `QUERYHUNTER_BASE_DIR`, as explained
in the [Installation](#installation) section below.
