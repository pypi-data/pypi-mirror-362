   :alt: UML chart of the MAICoS core classes

MAICoS analysis modules are built on top of stacked :ref:`core_classes` as shown in the
UML chart above. For spatial dependent analysis, these are split into the geometries:

* :ref:`planar_classes`,
* :ref:`cylinder_classes`,
* and :ref:`sphere_classes`.

Each sub class inherits attributes and provides geometry-specific methods and
attributes. The flow chart is shown in the figure above. The foundation for all these
classes is :class:`AnalysisBase <maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>`, inherited and extended
from :class:`MDAnalysis.analysis.base.AnalysisBase`. :class:`AnalysisBase
<maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>` takes case of the general aspects of each analysis,
which will be discussed in detail below:

1. **Atom Selection -** MAICoS builds on top of the MDAnalysis Universe and atom
   selection system, therefore all analysis modules work only on subsets of the whole
   simulation. This allows investigating different species components individually, for
   example splitting the contributions of solvent and solute to a single observable.
   Moreover, many MAICoS analysis modules are able to process several atom selections
   from one simulation within one analysis run by providing a :class:`list` of atom
   selections. This reduces I/O loads and operations and gains a speed up for the
   analysis.

1. **Translational coordinate transformations and unit cell wrapping -** MAICoS works
   with a reference structure denoted by ``refgroup`` which center of mass (com for
   short) serves as the coordinate origin for every analysis. MDAnalysis's cell
   dimension and coordinates range from 0 to ``L`` where ``L`` is the dimension of the
   simulation box. Therefore, MAICoS defines the origin at the center of the simulation
   cell.

   Within each frame of the analysis, the ``refgroup``'s com is translated to the origin
   and all coordinates are wrapped into the primary unit cell. Additionally, it is
   possible to unwrap molecules afterwards since some analysis require whole molecules
   (e.g. dielectric). With this centering, the investigation of systems that translate
   over time is made possible, such as for example soft interfaces or moving molecules.
   However, users are not forced to give a ``refgroup``. If no such reference structure
   is given, MAICoS takes the frame specific center of the simulation cell as the
   origin.

   User-provided ranges for spatial analysis are always with respect to the ``refgroup``
   and not in absolute box coordinates. For example, a 1-dimensional planar analysis
   ranging from -2 (Ã…) to 0 considers atoms on the left half space of the ``refgroup``.

2. **Trajectory iteration -** Each module implements an initialization, a prepare, a
   single frame and a conclude method. The :class:`AnalysisBase
   <maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>` will perform an analysis that is based on these
   provided methods. It is possible to provide an initial and final frame as well as a
   step size or to analyse individual frames.

3. **Time averaging of observables -** For observables that have to be time-averaged,
   :class:`AnalysisBase <maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>` provides a frame dictionary.
   Each key has to be updated within the (private) ``_single_frame`` method and the mean
   and the variance of each observable will be provided within a ``mean`` and a ``var``
   dictionary. Each key name within these two dictionaries is the same as within the
   frame dictionary.

4. **On-the-fly output -** MAICoS is able to update analysis results during the
   analysis. This can be particularly useful for long analysis providing a way to check
   the correctness of analysis parameters during the run.

5. **Correlation time estimation -** For the calculation of the mean and the standard
   deviation, MAICoS assumes uncorrelated data to compute reasonable error estimates.
   Since users may not know the correlation time within their simulation, MAICoS
   estimates correlation times for representative observables and warns users if their
   averages are obtained from correlated data. The correlation analysis gets handled by
   :class:`AnalysisBase <maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>` if the ``single_frame`` method
   of the used class returns a value to perform the analysis on. You can find general
   info about which class uses which observable for the analysis below, and more
   detailed information in the :ref:`userdoc_api-documentation`. The correlation time
   gets calculated using the :func:`correlation time function
   <maicos.lib.math.correlation_time>`. The generation of warnings for the users gets
   handled by the :func:`correlation analysis
   function<maicos.lib.util.correlation_analysis>`.

   For dielectric analysis, MAICoS uses the total dipole moment parallel to the
   direction of the analysis. For other spatial-dependant analysis, the correlation time
   is estimated from the central bin of the refgroup; in the center of the simulation
   cell. This translates to the middle bin of the profile for planar analyses and the
   first bin for cylindrical or spherical profiles.

--------------------------
Spatial Dependent Analysis
--------------------------

Spatial dependent analyses are crucial for interfacial and confined systems. Based on
the :class:`AnalysisBase <maicos.core.base.AnalysisBase>` in combination with a
:class:`ProfileBase <maicos.core.base.ProfileBase>` class, MAICoS provides intermediate
:ref:`core_classes` for the three main geometries:

* :class:`maicos.core.planar.PlanarBase`,
* :class:`maicos.core.cylinder.CylinderBase`,
* and :class:`maicos.core.sphere.SphereBase`.

These modules take care of the coordinate transformations, of the spatial boundaries,
and of the spatial resolution of the analysis.

A design concept of MAICoS for spatial analysis is that the user always provides the
spatial resolution via the *bin_width* parameter rather than a number of bins.
Therefore, the same analysis code is easily transferable to different simulation sizes
without additional considerations about the spatial resolution.

Based on the three geometric base classes, three corresponding high level classes are
provided:

* :class:`maicos.core.planar.ProfilePlanarBase`,
* :class:`maicos.core.cylinder.ProfileCylinderBase`,
* and :class:`maicos.core.sphere.ProfileSphereBase`.

When developing a new analysis class based on one of theses three classes, only a single
*weight* function has to be provided. All current :ref:`weighting_functions` are
documented. For instance, the atomic weight could be the masses, thus resulting in mass
density profiles as done in :ref:`DensityPlanar`, atomic or molecular velocities as for
:ref:`VelocityPlanar`, or the dipolar orientations as used by the :ref:`DiporderPlanar`
class.

More details on each base class are given in the :ref:`userdoc_api-documentation`. For
detailed information on the physical principles of each module consider the following
sections.
