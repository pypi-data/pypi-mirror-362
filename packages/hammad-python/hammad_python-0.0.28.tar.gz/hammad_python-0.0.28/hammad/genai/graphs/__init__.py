"""hammad.genai.graphs - Graph-based workflow framework built on pydantic-graph

This module provides a high-level interface for creating graph-based workflows
that integrate seamlessly with hammad's Agent and LanguageModel infrastructure.

Key Features:
- Action decorator system for defining graph nodes
- Automatic integration with Agent and LanguageModel
- IDE-friendly type hints and parameter unpacking
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Built on pydantic-graph for robust execution

Basic Usage:
    from hammad.genai.graphs import BaseGraph, action
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class MyState(BaseModel):
        count: int = 0

    class CountingGraph(BaseGraph[MyState, str]):
        @action.start()
        def start_counting(self, ctx, agent, target: int):
            # Use agent for AI operations
            response = agent.run(f"Count from 1 to {target}")
            return response.output

    # Usage
    graph = CountingGraph()
    result = graph.run(target=5)
    print(result.output)

Advanced Usage with Plugins:
    from hammad.genai.graphs import plugin

    @plugin.history(summarize=True)
    @plugin.memory(collection_name="counting")
    class AdvancedGraph(BaseGraph[MyState, str]):
        @action.start(instructions="You are a helpful counting assistant")
        def count_with_memory(self, ctx, agent, target: int):
            # Agent will have instructions and plugins automatically applied
            return agent.run(f"Count to {target} and remember this session")
