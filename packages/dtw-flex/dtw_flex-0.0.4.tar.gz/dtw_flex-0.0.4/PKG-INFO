# dtw_flex

## Description
This package allows to match flexibel user defined data patterns in a data array. The algorithm is based on dynamic time warping (dtw) but contains considerable changes. In contrast to classical dtw, an offset and amplitude are dynamically calculated. Moreover, the user can specify weights and allowable repetitions for each data point. Note that this algorithm is greedy and does not guarantee an optimal solution. 

The algorithm is also implemented in cython for better performance. The package also implements a running window in order to analyse longer data arrays. 
Pattern initialisation and point tracking can be set through a visual interface
