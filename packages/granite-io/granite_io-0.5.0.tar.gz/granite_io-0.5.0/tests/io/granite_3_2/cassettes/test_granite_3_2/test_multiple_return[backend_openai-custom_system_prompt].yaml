      help you understand this in simple ways, let's imagine you have a piggy bank
      with money from your toys that grows over time because of big helpers (dividends).\\n\\n1.
      **Saving the Money**: One good thing is saving the money you get as dividends
      right back into the same piggy bank it came from. That way, more money can grow
      in it through future dividends. This means less \\\"tax\\\" time later because
      you didn't spend it before the tax happens.\\n\\n2. **Using Special Pockets**:
      Sometimes, your toy helpers let you put some of that grown-up money into a little
      extra piggy bank without touching it, and this part doesn't have to pay \\\"tax\\\"
      yet. It's like having a secret treasure chest!\\n\\n3. **Talking to Helpers**:
      It\u2019s nice to speak with your big helper (a tax accountant) who can tell
      you more about how much they expect you might need to give back as tax. They
      know the rules of how money grows and when the tax fairy comes out to take a
      bit at the end.\\n\\nRemember, wearing smarter clothes (tax strategies) doesn't
      change that you still have play-withable money \u2013 it's just more organized.
      So, let these ideas help grow your piggy bank while managing any small \\\"fees\\\"
      to the tax fairy!\",\"index\":0,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":84,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"total_tokens\":386}}\n"
