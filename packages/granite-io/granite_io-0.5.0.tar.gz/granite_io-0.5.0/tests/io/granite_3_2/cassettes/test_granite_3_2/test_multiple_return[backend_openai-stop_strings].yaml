      popular tongue twister, the question \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?
      If a woodchuck could chuck wood, he''d chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could
      chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.\" This is a humorous line with no definitive
      answer, as it''s a joke based on the factual but implausible assumption that
      woodchucks (also known as groundhogs) do indeed chuck wood. In reality, woodchucks
      are burrowing animals and primarily eat vegetation, not wood.","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"prompt_logprobs":null},{"index":1,"text":"This

      a ton of dirt or 700 pounds of wood. In reality, woodchucks are burrowing animals

      speculation. According to various estimates, if we imagine a woodchuck were
      busily digging a significant burrow, it could move around 700 pounds of soil,
      which includes a significant amount of wood debris. However, the phrase is more
      famous for its playful language and the delightful challenge it presents, rather
      than a precise scientific measurement.","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"prompt_logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":70,"total_tokens":458,"completion_tokens":388,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}'
