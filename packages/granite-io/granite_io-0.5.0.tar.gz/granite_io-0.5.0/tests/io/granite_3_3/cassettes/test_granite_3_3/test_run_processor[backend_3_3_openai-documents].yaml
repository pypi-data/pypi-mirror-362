        A thesaurus is a reference work that provides lists of words in one language,
        together with information about their meanings, etymologies, and functions
        in sentences. However, it does not appear that either document from your list
        uses this term; they both seem to focus on personal reflections or experiences
        related to \"the past.\"  If you''re interested in synonyms or alternative
