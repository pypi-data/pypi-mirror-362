      I''d be happy to demonstrate how chat templating works. Chat templating is a
      method of dynamically generating content based on user input or other variables.\n\nIn
      a typical chat interface, templating allows for the insertion of variables into
      pre-defined templates. This way, the system can generate a response tailored
      to the user''s interaction.\n\nFor example, a simple template could be:\n\n\"Hello,
      {{user_name}}! You''ve entered the chat. How can I assist you today?\"\n\nHere,
      \"{{user_name}}\" would be a placeholder that the system would replace with
      the actual user''s name when generating the response.\n\nWould you like to see
      an example of a more complex templating scenario?","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"prompt_logprobs":null},{"index":2,"text":"Sure,
      I''d be happy to help you understand chat templating! In a general sense, chat
      templating involves using a template to generate responses dynamically based
      on input. This can be done using different methods, depending on the platform
      or technology you''re using.\n\nFor instance, in a web application, you might
      use a templating engine like Jinja (Python), Handlebars, or Mustache to create
      reusable templates with placeholders for dynamic data. When the user''s input
      generates a specific set of data, the templating engine fills the placeholders,
      generating a complete, personalized response.\n\nIf you''re referring to a specific
      chat platform or tool, please ensure to mention it, and I can provide a more
      tailored explanation.","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"prompt_logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":98,"total_tokens":446,"completion_tokens":348,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}'
