    Calculates the complement of normalized Levenshtein distance (1-NLD) between two sequences.
    Levenshtein distance is the number of edits required to transform one sequence into another, and its normalization
    is with respect to the size of the GT (equivalent to the WER measure used in speech recognition). This normalization
    may result in a value exceeding 1 if the predicted sequence is longer than the GT sequence, meaning the complement
    (1-NLD) may be negative.
    For more information on using 1-NLD in eye-tracking, see https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01763-7
