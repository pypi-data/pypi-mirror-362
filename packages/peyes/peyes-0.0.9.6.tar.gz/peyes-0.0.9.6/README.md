# pEYES
## A Python Package for Eye-Tracking Researchers

pEYES is a Python package that enables researchers to perform robust, quantitative comparisons of eye-tracking
segmentation algorithms. It provides implementations of several widely used algorithms and allows users to evaluate
their performance against ground-truth, human-annotated datasets. The package simplifies the process of selecting an
optimal algorithm by offering over 20 metrics to quantify performance, enhancing analysis reliability and reproducibility.

## Overview
pEYES offers several core functionalities designed to facilitate the processing, analysis, and comparison of
eye-tracking data:
- **Downloading & Parsing Datasets**: Provides functions to easily download and parse publicly available,
human-annotated eye-tracking datasets, streamlining the setup process for benchmarking algorithms.
- **Configuring & Running Detection Algorithms**: Allows users to configure various eye-tracking segmentation algorithms
and apply them to either the built-in datasets or their own custom data.
- **Algorithm Comparison & Analysis**: Offers tools to analyze the results of detection algorithms, compare their
performance against human-annotated ground-truth data, or evaluate differences between multiple algorithms.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes visualization capabilities, such as generating fixation heatmaps and saccade
trajectories, to help users intuitively interpret the results of different detection algorithms.

This functionality makes pEYES a versatile tool for researchers aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of their
eye-tracking data analysis.
