Pydantic models for Exobrain Actions management.

This package provides Pydantic models for managing Exobrain Actions schemas.
It is designed to be used as a dependency in REST API clients, web services
built with FastAPI or Flask, or any other Python application that requires
strict data validation and serialization for Exobrain Actions management.

Key features:

- Typed data models for Exobrain Actions
- Support for modern Pydantic (>=2.11.7, <3)
- Can be integrated into server or client-side projects

## Development workflow

### Prerequisites

Before starting development, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/)**: a modern Python project, environment, and packaging manager.

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: a fast Python package installer and resolver.

### Project Structure

- **Code:** Place your models in `exobrain/actions/schemas/`.
- **Tests:** Add your tests in `tests/`.

### Development Commands

All tasks (testing, linting, type checking, packaging, etc.) are managed via **hatch** environments and scripts:

#### 1. Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies (including development tools):

```shell
hatch env create
```

#### 2. Running Tests

Launch all tests using `pytest`:

```shell
hatch test
```

#### 3. Linting and Formatting

Format your code:

```shell
hatch fmt -f
```

Check code style:

```shell
hatch fmt
```

#### 4. Type Checking

Run type checks with `mypy`:

```shell
hatch run types:check
```

#### 5. Coverage

Check test coverage with:

```shell
hatch test --cover
```

#### 6. Building the Package

Build the package for distribution:

```shell
hatch build
```

#### 7. Releasing

The release process uses **uv** and Github Actions.

- For pre-release on TestPyPI: push a tag with `rc` or `beta` in the version (`0.1rc1`, `0.2b1` etc.).
- For release: push a tag type `v0.1` (main release) on `main` branch.
- Configure secrets for PyPI tokens in repository settings (`PYPI_TOKEN`, `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`).

### Continuous Integration

All pushes and pull requests on `main` or `development` branches trigger the Continuous Integration pipeline  
(see `.github/workflows/` directory for details).
