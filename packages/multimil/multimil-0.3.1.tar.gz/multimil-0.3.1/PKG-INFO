## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

- [API documentation][link-api]

and the tutorials:

- [Classification with MIL](https://multimil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/mil_classification.html) [![Open In Colab][badge-colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/theislab/multimil/blob/main/docs/notebooks/mil_classification.ipynb)

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. We recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

To create and activate a new environment:

```bash
mamba create --name multimil python=3.10
mamba activate multimil
```

Next, there are several alternative options to install multimil:

1. Install the latest release of `multimil` from [PyPI][link-pypi]:

```bash
pip install multimil
```

2. Or install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/theislab/multimil.git@main
```

## Release notes

See the [changelog][changelog].

## Contact

If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].
