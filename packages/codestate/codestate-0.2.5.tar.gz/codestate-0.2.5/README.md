A CLI tool that analyzes your local codebase and generates detailed statistics, such as lines of code per file type, function complexity, comment density, and more. It visualizes the data as ASCII charts or exports to JSON, HTML, or Markdown for further use. This tool is designed for developers who want quick insights into their project's structure without relying on external services.

## Installation

```bash
pip install codestate
```

Or for local development:

```bash
pip install .
```

```bash
codestate [directory] [options]
```
