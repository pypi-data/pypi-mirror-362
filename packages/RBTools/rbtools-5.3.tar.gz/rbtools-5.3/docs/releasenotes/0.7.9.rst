===========================
RBTools 0.7.9 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date:** January 13, 2017


Installers
==========

macOS
-----

* Fixed an issue with a bad build of the macOS installer.

  The previously "improved" build was actually built incorrectly, preventing
  users from being able to actually use RBTools. The new build should be
  compatible with most systems.

  Note that if you've completely replaced your system-standard Python with a
  version from Homebrew or another third-party package software, and the
  system Python directories are not in your :envvar:`PATH`, then you'll need
  to install the new RBTools using :command:`pip` instead. Instructions
  are available on the `RBTools downloads page`_.

  If you have a :file:`/Users/chipx86` directory on your filesystem from
  the previous (0.7.8) installer, please delete it. This was an artifact of
  the broken build.
