===========================
RBTools 0.4.3 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: January 28, 2013


New Features
============

* Added support for posting from Bazaar repositories. Patch by Max Rabkin.
  (:bug:`773`)

* Passing ``--basedir`` to :command:`post-review` will override
  the computed base directory used for Subversion diffs.

* Added better support for moved files in Perforce.

  Moved files in Git and Perforce now have additional information in the diffs
  that, on a modern Review Board server, will generate nicer diffs, instead
  of showing a big deleted file and a big added file.

  This requires Review Board 1.7.3 or higher.


Bug Fixes
=========

General
-------

* Fixed problems authenticating with the server when anonymous access is
  disabled. Patch by Xiaodang Xu. (:bug:`2429`, :bug:`2430`)

* Fixed loading settings from the user's :file:`~/.reviewboardrc` when it's
  the only :file:`.reviewboardrc` in the search path. Patch by
  Markku Linnoskivi.

* Fixed a crash when the user's home directory isn't writable. (:bug:`2344`)

* Added a fallback when failing to get the API version from a Review Board
  server. Patch by Damian Johnson.

* The "Username" prompt is now printed to stderr instead of stdout, to match
  the "Password" prompt's inputted text. (:bug:`2831`)

* Unicode URLs are now encoded as UTF-8, preventing an encoding conflict when
  talking to Review Board. (:bug:`2238`)


Git
---

* Git diffs no longer contain move/rename information if the Review Board
  server doesn't support it. Patch by Dave Druska.
