RBTools 1.0.1 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date:** July 24, 2018


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed ``putch`` errors when requesting password input on Windows
  (:bug:`4711`).

  A regression in 1.0 caused password prompts to fail when running with Python
  2.7.x on Windows. This has been fixed.

* Fixed tracking branch detection with Git.

  RBTools 1.0 introduced a new mechanism for minimizing the amount of data sent
  to Review Board when posting dependent changes, but it was too aggressive
  when the branch being posted was pushed to the remote, overriding the
  configured tracking branch. This could result in errors about there being no
  diffs.

  This has been fixed to always respect the configured parent or tracking
  branch, and the diff size minimization algorithm is only used when
  determining the merge base for the remote.
