Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed issues when running certain commands outside of a source tree with the
  :rbtconfig:`TREES` setting.

  Some commands, such as :rbtcommand:`rbt patch --print` or :rbtcommand:`rbt
  api-get`, can be run outside of a source tree, because they do not interact
  with the repository at all. RBTools 5.2 contained a regression when using
  these commands with the :rbtconfig:`TREES` setting, causing these commands
  to error out with a message about not being able to find the repository.
