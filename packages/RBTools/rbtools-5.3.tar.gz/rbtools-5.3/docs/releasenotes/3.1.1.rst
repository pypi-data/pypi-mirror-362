RBTools 3.1.1 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date:** June 14, 2022


Bug Fixes
=========

rbt patch
---------

* Fixed the display of filenames when encountering conflicts on Python 3.

  Filenames were being shown with a ``b'`` prefix, indicating a Python
  bytestring.


rbt post
--------

* Fixed a regression with posting an existing diff using
  :option:`--diff-filename <rbt post --diff-filename>`.

  Due to an internal change, this was crashing before posting for review.

* Fixed File Not Found errors to show the missing revision alongside the
  filename.


IBM ClearCase / HCL VersionVault
--------------------------------

* Fixed generating diffs when directories are added or deleted.

* Fixed regressions when posting changes against repositories configured using
  the legacy ClearCase support shipped in Review Board.

  We recommend that all legacy ClearCase users migrate to the new support in
  `Power Pack`_.

Mercurial
---------

* Fixed a regression in applying patches using :ref:`rbt land <rbt-land>` or
  :ref:`rbt patch <rbt-patch>` in Mercurial.

  This regressed in RBTools 3.1.
