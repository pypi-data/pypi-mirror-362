RBTools 3.1.2 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date:** October 3, 2022


Windows Installer
=================

* The RBTools for Windows installer now ships Python 3.8.14, the latest in
  the 3.8.x series.

  RBTools 3.x will be the last to support Windows installers compatible with
  Windows 7.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed compatibility with Python 3.11.

  Some changes in Python 3.11's standard library caused RBTools commands to
  fail.


IBM ClearCase / HCL VersionVault
--------------------------------

* Restored old directory content entries in diffs.

  The community-driven ClearCase implementation used to show changes to
  directory elements by doing a diff of the ``ls`` output. This behavior was
  removed in RBTools 3.0 but has been restored.

* Fixed errors when posted changes included added or removed symbolic links.


Perforce
--------

* Fixed Unicode errors when using git-p4 and Python 3.x.
