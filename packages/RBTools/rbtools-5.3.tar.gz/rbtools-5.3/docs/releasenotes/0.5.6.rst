===========================
RBTools 0.5.6 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: January 29, 2014


Bug Fixes
=========

rbt diff
--------

.. program:: rbt diff

* Added missing ``--p4-*`` arguments.

  This includes :option:`--p4-client`, :option:`--p4-port`, and
  :option:`--p4-passwd`.


rbt post
--------

* Perforce repositories are no longer matched when outside of the checkout.
  (:bug:`3171`)

  Previously, if ``p4 info`` showed a valid repository, ``rbt post`` would
  assume it matched the current directory, and try to post with it. This
  would cause problems if the Perforce repository check occurred before
  the check for the type of repository in the current directory.

  We now validate that the result of ``p4 info`` matches the current
  directory before assuming it's correct.

* Fixed a crash when using ``rbt post -u CLN``. (:bug:`3197`)

rbt setup-repo
--------------

* Fixed a Python 2.4 compatibility issue. (:bug:`3193`)

  Patch by Dan Porter.


rbt status
----------

.. program:: rbt status

* No longer crashes with Perforce repositories. (:bug:`3184`)

* Added missing ``--p4-*`` arguments.

  This includes :option:`--p4-client`, :option:`--p4-port`, and
  :option:`--p4-passwd`.


API
---

* Fixed issues with successive calls to ``.create()`` or ``.update()``
  on resources. (:bug:`3197`)
