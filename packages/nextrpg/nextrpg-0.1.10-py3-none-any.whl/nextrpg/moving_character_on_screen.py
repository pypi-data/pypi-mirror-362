"""
Moving character implementation for NextRPG.

This module provides the base class for characters that can move around
the game world. It handles movement calculations, collision detection,
and character state management during movement.

The module defines the `MovingCharacterOnScreen` abstract base class
that provides the foundation for both player and NPC movement systems.
It includes collision detection against map boundaries and objects,
movement speed calculations, and proper character animation states.

Key Features:
    - Abstract movement interface for characters
    - Collision detection against polygon boundaries
    - Movement speed and direction handling
    - Character animation state management
    - Event-driven movement controls

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.moving_character_on_screen import MovingCharacterOnScreen
    from nextrpg.core import Direction, Millisecond
    from nextrpg.coordinate import Coordinate

    class MyMovingCharacter(MovingCharacterOnScreen):
        @cached_property
        def moving(self) -> bool:
            return self.is_moving

        def move(self, time_delta: Millisecond) -> Coordinate:
            # Calculate new position based on movement
            return self.coordinate.shift(movement_vector)
    ```

    Abstract base class for characters that can move around the game world.

    This class provides the foundation for movement-capable characters,
    including collision detection, movement calculations, and proper
    animation state management. It's designed to be extended by both
    player characters and NPCs that need movement capabilities.

    Arguments:
        `collisions`: Tuple of polygons representing collision boundaries
            that the character cannot pass through.

        `move_speed`: Movement speed in pixels per millisecond.
            Defaults to the global character configuration.

    Example:
        ```python
        class PlayerCharacter(MovingCharacterOnScreen):
            @cached_property
            def moving(self) -> bool:
                return bool(self.pressed_keys)

            def move(self, time_delta: Millisecond) -> Coordinate:
                return self.calculate_new_position(time_delta)

        Get whether the character is currently moving.

        This property should be implemented by subclasses to determine
        if the character should be in a moving state. This affects
        both animation and movement calculations.

        Returns:
            `bool`: Whether the character is currently moving.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to calculate

        if no collision is detected.

        Arguments:
            `time_delta`: The time that has passed since the last update
                in milliseconds.

        Returns:
            `Coordinate`: The updated character position after the move step.
