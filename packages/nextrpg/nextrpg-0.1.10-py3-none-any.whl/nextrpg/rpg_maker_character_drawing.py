"""
RPG Maker character drawing implementation for NextRPG.

This module provides functionality for rendering RPG Maker-style character
sprites with support for different sprite sheet formats and animation patterns.
It includes support for both RPG Maker VX/VX Ace/MV/MZ and XP sprite sheet
formats, with automatic frame extraction and animation handling.

The module supports various RPG Maker sprite sheet layouts, character
selection from multi-character sheets, frame trimming, and both idle
and movement animations. It's designed to be compatible with existing
RPG Maker resources while providing modern animation capabilities.

Note that `nextrpg` is only compatible with the RPG Maker character
sprite sheet to be able to re-use existing resources. However, using
RPG Maker's Runtime Time Package (RTP) in non-RPG Maker framework
violates the license of RPG Maker, even if you own a copy of RPG Maker.

Key Features:
    - RPG Maker VX/VX Ace/MV/MZ sprite sheet support
    - RPG Maker XP sprite sheet support
    - Multi-character sprite sheet selection
    - Frame trimming and cropping
    - Idle and movement animations
    - Configurable animation timing
    - Direction-based frame selection

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.rpg_maker_character_drawing import (
        RpgMakerCharacterDrawing, SpriteSheet, SpriteSheetSelection
    )
    from nextrpg.draw_on_screen import Drawing

    # Create a sprite sheet configuration
    sprite_sheet = SpriteSheet(
        drawing=Drawing.load("characters.png"),
        style=DefaultFrameType
    )

    # Create character drawing
    character = RpgMakerCharacterDrawing(
        sprite_sheet=sprite_sheet,
        sprite_sheet_selection=SpriteSheetSelection(row=0, column=0),
        animate_on_idle=True
    )
    ```
