"""
Player character implementation for NextRPG.

This module provides the `PlayerOnScreen` class that handles player
character movement, input processing, and interaction with the game
world. It extends the base moving character functionality with
keyboard input handling and player-specific behaviors.

The player character responds to keyboard input for movement in all
eight directions (orthogonal and diagonal), handles key press and
release events, and manages movement state based on currently
pressed keys.

Key Features:
    - Keyboard input processing for movement
    - Eight-directional movement support
    - Key press and release event handling
    - Movement state management
    - Collision detection integration

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.player_on_screen import PlayerOnScreen
    from nextrpg.character_drawing import CharacterDrawing
    from nextrpg.coordinate import Coordinate

    # Create a player character
    player = PlayerOnScreen(
        character=CharacterDrawing(drawing=player_sprite),
        coordinate=Coordinate(100, 100),
        collisions=map_collisions
    )

    # Handle input events
    player = player.event(key_press_event)
    ```

    Player character that responds to keyboard input for movement.

    This class extends `MovingCharacterOnScreen` to provide player-specific
    functionality including keyboard input processing, movement state
    management, and proper character direction handling based on
    currently pressed movement keys.

    The player supports movement in all eight directions (orthogonal
    and diagonal) with proper key combination handling. Movement
    keys are tracked and the character's direction is updated
    accordingly.

    Arguments:
        `_movement_keys`: Internal set of currently pressed movement keys.
            This is managed automatically by the event system.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.player_on_screen import PlayerOnScreen
        from nextrpg.character_drawing import CharacterDrawing

        player = PlayerOnScreen(
            character=CharacterDrawing(drawing=player_sprite),
            coordinate=Coordinate(100, 100),
            collisions=map_collisions

        # Handle keyboard events

        Start an event interaction with another character.
