"""
Transition scene system for NextRPG.

This module provides transition scene functionality for smooth
scene changes in NextRPG games. It includes the `TransitionScene`
class which handles crossfade transitions between scenes.

The transition scene system features:
- Crossfade transitions between scenes
- Configurable transition duration
- Alpha-based blending
- Intermediary scene support

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.transition_scene import TransitionScene
    from nextrpg.scene import Scene
    from nextrpg.core import Millisecond

    # Create transition scene
    transition = TransitionScene(
        from_scene=current_scene,
        intermediary=intermediary_scene,
        to_scene=next_scene,
        duration=Millisecond(1000)
    )

    # Update transition in game loop
    scene = transition.tick(time_delta)
    ```

    Base class for scenes that support transitions.

    This class provides a base for scenes that can participate
    in transitions. It includes a method for updating without
    triggering transition effects.

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyScene(TransitioningScene):
            def tick_without_transition(self, time_delta):
                # Update scene without transition effects

        Update the scene without triggering transition effects.

        Arguments:
            `time_delta`: The elapsed time in milliseconds.

            `TransitioningScene`: Updated scene instance.

class TransitionScene(Scene):
    """
    Scene that handles transitions between other scenes.

    This class provides crossfade transition functionality between
    scenes. It manages the transition timing and alpha blending
    of drawing resources from multiple scenes.

    Arguments:
        `from_scene`: The scene to transition from.

        `intermediary`: The intermediary scene used during transition.

        `to_scene`: The scene to transition to.

        `duration`: The duration of the transition in milliseconds.
            Defaults to the global transition duration.

        `_elapsed`: Internal elapsed time tracking.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.transition_scene import TransitionScene
        from nextrpg.scene import Scene
