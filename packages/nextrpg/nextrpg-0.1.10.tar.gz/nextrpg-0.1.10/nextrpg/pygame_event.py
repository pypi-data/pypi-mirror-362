"""
Typed event system for pygame events in NextRPG.

This module provides a type-safe wrapper system for pygame events,
converting raw pygame events into strongly-typed event objects.
It includes event classes for keyboard input, window management,
and game control events.

The event system features:
- Type-safe event wrappers for all pygame events
- Keyboard key mapping and enumeration
- Window resize event handling
- Quit event processing
- Integration with the key mapping configuration system

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.pygame_event import to_typed_event, KeyPressDown
    from nextrpg.keyboard_key import KeyboardKey

    # Convert pygame event to typed event
    typed_event = to_typed_event(pygame_event)

    # Handle specific event types
    if isinstance(typed_event, KeyPressDown):
        if typed_event.key == KeyboardKey.LEFT:
            # Handle left arrow press
            pass
    ```

        `CONFIRM`: Represents the space key or enter key.
