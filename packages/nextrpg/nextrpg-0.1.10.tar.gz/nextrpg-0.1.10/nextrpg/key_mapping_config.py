"""
Type alias for keyboard key codes used in pygame.

This type alias represents integer constants that identify specific keys
on the keyboard (like K_LEFT, K_RIGHT, etc.) as defined by pygame.
These codes are used in key mapping configurations and event handling.

    """
    Configuration class for keyboard key mappings.

    This class defines the mapping between game actions and keyboard keys.
    Used by `nextrpg.event.pygame_event.KeyboardKey`,
    and the input handling system to translate keyboard input into game actions.

    Attributes:
        `left`: Key code for moving left. The default is `K_LEFT`.

        `right`: Key code for moving right. The default is `K_RIGHT`.

        `up`: Key code for moving up. The default is `K_UP`.

        `down`: Key code for moving down. The default is `K_DOWN`.

        `confirm`: Key code for confirming actions. The default is `K_SPACE`.

        `gui_mode_toggle`: Key code for toggling between
            windowed and full screen mode. The default is `F1`.
