"""NPC (Non-Player Character) system for NextRPG.

This module provides the core NPC functionality for the NextRPG game engine.
It includes classes for managing NPCs on screen, event specifications,
and scene management for player-NPC interactions.

The module defines:
- NpcOnScreen: In-game NPC interface for stationary NPCs
- EventfulScene: Scene that supports event execution via coroutines/generators
- RpgEventScene: Scene wrapper for RPG events
- NpcSpec: Base class for NPC specifications
- Type aliases for event specifications and generators

Example:
    ```python
    # Create an NPC specification
    npc_spec = NpcSpec(
        name="Shopkeeper",
        drawing=character_drawing,
        event=shop_dialog_event
    )

    # Create an NPC on screen
    npc = NpcOnScreen(spec=npc_spec)

    # Create an eventful scene with NPCs
    scene = EventfulScene(
        player=player,
        npcs=(npc,)
    )
    ```
