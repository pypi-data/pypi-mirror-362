"""
Character on-screen representation for NextRPG.

This module provides the base classes for characters that can be
displayed and interacted with on screen. It includes character
specifications, on-screen character management, and event handling
for character interactions.

The module defines the foundational classes for character representation,
including character specifications, on-screen positioning, drawing
management, and event interaction capabilities.

Key Features:
    - Character specification and configuration
    - On-screen character positioning and drawing
    - Event interaction handling
    - Character state management
    - Visual representation management

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.character_on_screen import CharacterOnScreen, CharacterSpec
    from nextrpg.character_drawing import CharacterDrawing
    from nextrpg.coordinate import Coordinate

    # Create a character specification
    spec = CharacterSpec(
        object_name="player",
        display_name="Hero",
        character=CharacterDrawing(drawing=player_sprite)
    )

    # Create an on-screen character
    character = CharacterOnScreen(
        spec=spec,
        coordinate=Coordinate(100, 100)
    )
    ```

    Specification for a character's properties and configuration.

    This class defines the basic properties of a character including
    its object name, display name, and character drawing. It serves
    as a template for creating character instances.

    Arguments:
        `object_name`: The unique identifier for the character object.
            Used for map object references and event triggers.

        `display_name`: The name displayed to the player for this character.
            Defaults to the object_name if not specified.

        `character`: The character drawing that defines the visual
            representation and animation of the character.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.character_on_screen import CharacterSpec

    """
    Represents a character that can be displayed and interacted with on screen.

    This class provides the foundation for all on-screen characters,
    including positioning, drawing management, event handling, and
    state management. It serves as the base class for both player
    characters and NPCs.

    The character maintains its position, visual representation,
    and event interaction capabilities. It can be updated over time
    and can participate in event-driven interactions with other
    characters or game elements.

    Arguments:
        `spec`: The character specification defining the character's
            properties and visual representation.

        `coordinate`: The current position of the character on screen.

        `name`: The display name of the character. Defaults to the
            specification's display name.

        `character`: The character drawing that defines the visual
            representation. Defaults to the specification's character.

        `_event_triggered`: Internal flag indicating if the character
            is currently participating in an event.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.character_on_screen import CharacterOnScreen
        from nextrpg.coordinate import Coordinate

        character = CharacterOnScreen(
