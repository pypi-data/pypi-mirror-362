"""
RPG event registration system for NextRPG.

This module provides a decorator-based event registration system
for RPG-style interactions. It allows functions to be marked as
event handlers that can be triggered by player or NPC interactions.

The RPG event system features:
- Function decorator for event registration
- Unique event name validation
- Global event registry
- Integration with player/NPC interaction systems

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.rpg_event import register_rpg_event

    @register_rpg_event
    def open_chest():
        # Handle chest opening event
        pass

    @register_rpg_event
    def talk_to_npc():
        # Handle NPC conversation event
        pass
    ```

    """
    Mark a function as an event handler.

    This decorator registers a function as an RPG event handler
    that can be triggered by player or NPC interactions. Each
    event must have a unique function name.

    Arguments:
        `fun`: Function with a unique name that handles
            player/NPC interaction.

    Returns:
        `Callable`: The original function.

    Raises:
        `ValueError`: If an event with the same name is already registered.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.rpg_event import register_rpg_event

        @register_rpg_event
        def open_door():
            # Handle door opening
            pass

        @register_rpg_event
        def collect_item():
            # Handle item collection
            pass
        ```
    """
    if fun.__name__ in registered_events:
        raise ValueError(f"Event {fun.__name__} already registered.")
    registered_events[fun.__name__] = fun
    return fun


registered_events: dict[str, Callable[..., None]] = {}
"""
Global registry of registered RPG events.

This dictionary stores all registered event handlers, mapping
function names to their corresponding callable functions.
