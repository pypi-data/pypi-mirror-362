"""
RPG Maker character drawing configuration system for NextRPG.

This module provides configuration options for RPG Maker character
sprites in NextRPG games. It includes the `RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig`
class which defines animation timing and behavior for character sprites.

The RPG Maker character drawing configuration features:
- Frame duration configuration
- Animation timing control
- RPG Maker sprite sheet compatibility
- Character animation behavior

Note: NextRPG is only compatible with the RPG Maker character
sprite sheet format to be able to re-use existing resources.
However, using RPG Maker's Runtime Time Package (RTP) in non-RPG
Maker frameworks violates the license of RPG Maker, even if you
own a copy of RPG Maker.

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.rpg_maker_character_drawing_config import RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig
    from nextrpg.core import Millisecond

    # Create default RPG Maker character config
    config = RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig()

    # Create custom RPG Maker character config
    custom_config = RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig(
        duration_per_frame=Millisecond(150)
    )
    ```

    """
    Configuration class for RPG Maker character drawings.

    This config is used by `nextrpg.character.rpg_maker_drawing.RpgMakerCharacterDrawing`
    to control how character sprites are animated and displayed. It defines the
    animation timing, idle behavior, and default orientation.

    Note that `nextrpg` is only compatible with the RPG Maker character
    sprite sheet format to be able to re-use existing resources.

    However, using RPG Maker's Runtime Time Package (RTP) in non-RPG
    Maker frameworks violates the license of RPG Maker, even if you
    own a copy of RPG Maker.

    Arguments:
        `duration_per_frame`: The default duration for a single frame
            for the character in milliseconds. Defaults to 200ms.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.rpg_maker_character_drawing_config import RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig
        from nextrpg.core import Millisecond

        # Default configuration
        config = RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig()

        # Fast animation configuration
        fast_config = RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig(
            duration_per_frame=Millisecond(100)
        )

        # Slow animation configuration
        slow_config = RpgMakerCharacterDrawingConfig(
            duration_per_frame=Millisecond(300)
        )
        ```
