"""
Path-based walking system for NextRPG.

This module provides a sophisticated walking system that allows characters
and objects to follow predefined paths with configurable movement speeds.
The system supports both linear and cyclic paths, with smooth movement
interpolation between path points.

The walking system includes:
- Path-based movement along polygon paths
- Configurable movement speed
- Support for cyclic (looping) and linear paths
- Smooth interpolation between path points
- Direction calculation based on movement
- Completion detection for linear paths

The system is designed to work seamlessly with the character movement
and animation systems, providing realistic path-following behavior.

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.walk import Walk
    from nextrpg.draw.draw_on_screen import Polygon
    from nextrpg.draw.coordinate import Coordinate

    # Create a path
    path = Polygon([
        Coordinate(0, 0),
        Coordinate(100, 0),
        Coordinate(100, 100),
        Coordinate(0, 100)
    ])

    # Create a walk instance
    walk = Walk(path=path, move_speed=50, cyclic=True)

    # Update movement
    walk = walk.tick(time_delta)
    ```

    """
    Path-based walking system for characters and objects.

    This class provides a complete walking system that allows entities
    to follow predefined paths with smooth movement. It supports both
    linear paths (with completion) and cyclic paths (looping).

    The walking system calculates movement based on time deltas and
    movement speed, providing smooth interpolation between path points.
    It also tracks direction changes for animation purposes.

    Arguments:
        `path`: The polygon path to follow.

        `move_speed`: Movement speed in pixels per millisecond.

        `cyclic`: Whether the path should loop continuously.
            If `True`, the walk will restart from the beginning
            when reaching the end. If `False`, the walk will
            complete when reaching the end.

        `coordinate`: Current position on the path. Automatically
            initialized to the path's starting point.

        `_last_coordinate`: Previous position for direction calculation.
            Automatically initialized to the path's starting point.

        `_index`: Current path point index.

        `_last_index`: Previous path point index.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.walk import Walk
        from nextrpg.draw.draw_on_screen import Polygon
        from nextrpg.draw.coordinate import Coordinate

        # Create a simple rectangular path
        path = Polygon([
            Coordinate(0, 0),
            Coordinate(100, 0),
            Coordinate(100, 100),
            Coordinate(0, 100)
        ])

        # Create a cyclic walk
        walk = Walk(path=path, move_speed=50, cyclic=True)

        # Update in game loop
        walk = walk.tick(time_delta)

        # Check if completed (for non-cyclic paths)
