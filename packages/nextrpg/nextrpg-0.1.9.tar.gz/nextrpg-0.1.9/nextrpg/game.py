"""
Main game loop and initialization for NextRPG.

This module provides the core game loop functionality and initialization
for NextRPG games. It handles the main game window setup, event
processing, scene management, and the primary game loop.

The module contains two main classes:
- `Game`: The main game controller that manages the game window and loop
- `_GameLoop`: Internal class that handles the actual game loop logic

The game loop processes events, updates scenes, and manages the GUI
components while maintaining a consistent frame rate.

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.game import Game
    from nextrpg.scene import StaticScene

    def create_entry_scene():
        return StaticScene()

    game = Game(entry_scene=create_entry_scene)
    game.start()  # Synchronous game loop
    # or
    await game.start_async()  # Asynchronous game loop
    ```

    """
    Main game controller that sets up the game window and manages the game loop.

    This class is responsible for initializing the game window, loading
    the entry scene, and managing the overall game state. It provides
    both synchronous and asynchronous game loop options.

    Arguments:
        `entry_scene`: A function that returns the entry scene.
            This must be a function rather than a direct `Scene` instance
            because drawings can only be loaded after pygame initialization.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.game import Game
        from nextrpg.scene import MapScene

        def create_scene():
            return MapScene("maps/town.tmx")

        game = Game(entry_scene=create_scene)
        game.start()

        Start the game in a local pygame window with synchronous game loop.

        This method runs the game loop synchronously, which is suitable
        for desktop applications. The game will run until the window is
        closed or the game loop is explicitly stopped.

        Example:
            ```python
            game = Game(entry_scene=create_scene)
            game.start()  # Blocks until game ends

        This method runs the game loop asynchronously, which is required
        for web deployment with pygbag. It yields control periodically
        to allow other async operations to run.

        Example:
            ```python
            game = Game(entry_scene=create_scene)
            await game.start_async()  # Non-blocking async loop

    This class handles the core game loop logic including event processing,
    scene updates, GUI management, and frame rate control. It's designed

    Arguments:
        `entry_scene`: Function that creates the initial scene.

        `running`: Whether the game loop should continue running.

        `_clock`: Pygame clock for frame rate control.
