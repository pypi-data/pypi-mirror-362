    """
    Configuration class for characters.

    This config is used by `nextrpg.character.character.Character`.

    Attributes:
        `move_speed`: The default speed of the character's movement
            in pixels on screen per physical millisecond.
            The number of pixels is consumed before screen scaling, if any.

        `idle_duration`: The duration of the NPC's idle duration.

        `move_duration`: The duration of the NPC's move duration.

        `directions`: The set of directions that the player can move.
            Default to all directions (up, left, right, down, and diagonals).
