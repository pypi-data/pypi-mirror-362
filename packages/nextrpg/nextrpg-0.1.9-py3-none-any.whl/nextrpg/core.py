"""
Core types and utilities used throughout the NextRPG framework.

This module provides fundamental data structures and utilities that are
referenced across the entire NextRPG framework. It includes:

- Color representation (`Rgba`)
- Directional movement (`Direction`, `DirectionalOffset`)
- Size and dimension handling (`Size`)
- Font management (`Font`)
- Timer utilities (`Timer`)
- Type aliases for common concepts

These types form the foundation for character movement, drawing,
and game mechanics throughout the framework.

Example:
    ```python
    from nextrpg.core import Direction, Size, Rgba

    # Create a size for a sprite
    sprite_size = Size(32, 32)

    # Define a color
    red_color = Rgba(255, 0, 0, 255)

    # Use directions for movement
    movement = Direction.UP
    ```

    This enum provides all possible directions for movement in a 2D grid,

class DirectionalOffset:

    Represents a directional offset for movement calculations.

    This class combines a direction (one of eight possible directions) with
    an offset value to define movement in 2D space. The vector can be used
    with coordinates to calculate new positions.

    Arguments:
        `direction`: The direction of the vector, defined by `Direction` enum.
            Supports both orthogonal (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
            and diagonal (`UP_LEFT`, `UP_RIGHT`, `DOWN_LEFT`, `DOWN_RIGHT`).

        `offset`: The length of movement in pixels.
            This value will be decomposed into x, y pixels upon diagonal moves.
