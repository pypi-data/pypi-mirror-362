Dear {{ user_name }},


Thanks for your request, I've just granted you permission to create new record drafts and upload files!
Here are a few things you should know:

*) For long-term file accessibility and preservation, we strongly recommend that you consult our file format guide:
   {{ config.THEME_TUW_FILE_FORMATS_URL }}

*) If you include code in your uploaded record, please make sure that it is easily reusable.
   It is good practice to provide a list of the required dependencies with their exact versions, e.g. in a language-specific project file or a README text file.
   Also, we recommend separating code from data via different directories, and using relative paths in code over absolute ones.

*) In addition to technical reusability, you should make sure that it is legally reusable by assigning appropriate licenses.
   For data, we generally recommend the CC-BY (4.0) license, while for code we recommend the MIT license.

*) Once a record is published, the set of uploaded files is fixed and cannot be changed anymore.
   However, you'll still be able to update the record's metadata after publication, e.g. to modify the description, or add new known citations to the record.

*) If you find that some files do need to be updated after publication (e.g. due to errata, or new/updated data), you can create a *new version* of the record.
   This will give you the opportunity to replace individual files from an already published record.
   The resulting new version will be a new record with its own DOI, which is strongly linked to the old version in the system however.

*) Access to the system is strongly linked to active university accounts.
   We recognise that every journey, including university affiliations, will eventually end.
   Therefore, it is a good idea to think of eventual succession plans for record maintenance, and nominate a future caretaker of the datasets.

We are happy to assist you with any questions on your data upload.
Some more information can be found in our upload guide: {{ config.THEME_TUW_UPLOAD_GUIDE_URL }}

{%+ if config.THEME_TUW_TEST_INSTANCE_URL +%}
As a final note, if you just want to play around and familiarize yourself with the system or just need to deposit data as part of an exercise, we also offer a test system: {{ config.THEME_TUW_TEST_INSTANCE_URL }}
This test system does not mint any live DOIs, and we reserve the right to arbitrarily clear its contents.
Otherwise, the functionality is pretty much identical, so it's an ideal playground.
{# note: the shape of this construct, including the {%+ ... +%} and this comment are relevant for the formatting #}
{%+ endif +%}
Best regards,
{{ current_user.user_profile.given_name }}
