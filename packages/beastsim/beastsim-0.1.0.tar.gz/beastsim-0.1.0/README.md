# BEASTsim: A Benchmarking and Analysis framework for Spatial Transcriptomics Simulations

**BEASTsim** (BEnchmarking and Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics simulations) is an advanced benchmarking framework designed to assess the performance of various simulation techniques used in spatial transcriptomics. This tool provides standardized testing and evaluation metrics, enabling researchers to compare different spatial transcriptomics simulators and provides tools for analysis of such spatial data.

## Features
 
BEASTsim has two modules; benchmarking and analysis. The benchmarking module evaluates spatial transcriptomics simulation across data property estimation, biological signal preservation, and similarity-based metrics. 
The analysis pipeline allows for more in dept analysis of the simulated tissues such as cell type neighborhoods, spatially variable genes, tissue similarity, and more.
