    """Claim the next highest-priority unblocked task.

    Atomically selects the highest-priority open task where all prerequisites
    are completed, updates its status to 'in-progress', optionally stamps the
    worktree field, and writes the changes to disk.

    Args:
        project_root: Root directory of the planning structure
