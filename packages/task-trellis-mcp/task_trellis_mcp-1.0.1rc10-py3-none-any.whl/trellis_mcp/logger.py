    Creates a thread-safe log entry with timestamp, level, message, and
    additional fields. Log entries are written to daily log files in the
    configured log directory using JSONL format (one JSON object per line).

    The log entry schema follows: {ts, level, msg, ...fields}

    Args:
        level: Log level (e.g., 'INFO', 'ERROR', 'DEBUG')
        msg: Log message describing the event
        settings: Optional Settings instance. If None, creates a new Settings instance.
        **fields: Additional fields to include in the log entry

    Raises:
        OSError: If there are issues creating directories or writing files
        IOError: If there are filesystem permission issues
        ValueError: If the log entry cannot be serialized to JSON

        >>> write_event('INFO', 'JSON-RPC call completed',
