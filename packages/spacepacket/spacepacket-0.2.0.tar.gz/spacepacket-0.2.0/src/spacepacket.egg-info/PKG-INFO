# Python Space Packet, Version 0.2

The CCSDS Space Packet Protocol (SPP) was developed by the
[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)](https://public.ccsds.org):

> The Space Packet Protocol is designed to meet the requirements of space missions to
efficiently transfer space application data of various types and characteristics over a network that involves a ground-to-space or space-to-space communications link (also called
space link).

>The figure below illustrates where the Space Packet Protocol is located in the protocol stack. The Space Packet Protocol provides a unidirectional data transfer service from a single source user application to one or more destination user applications through one or more subnetworks. The path from the source user application to the destination user application(s) through the subnetwork(s) is called a Logical Data Path (LDP).
