## How to Turn Any Website into a Full-Screen App on Your iPhone

Here are the steps to turn any website into a full screen app on your iPhone:

1.  **Install the 'Make App from Web URL' shortcut:** You will be automatically redirected to Shortcuts, but if not, tap "Get Shortcut." When the install page appears in Shortcuts, you can tap the ellipsis (•••) to preview the workflow. Tap "Add Shortcut" to install it.
    * iCloud Link: [Make App from Web URL (free)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7f7c6d1b7b5f4a9e8b3e8e1b0b5f0d3f)
2.  **Get an Image for the App Icon:** The shortcut lets you choose any image from the Photos app, so you can download one from the web or use an existing one.
3.  **Create the Configuration Profile:** You'll need the website URL in your iPhone's clipboard, or you can type it manually. Alternatively, you can share the website to the shortcut using the share sheet, which can be faster.
4.  **Download the Configuration Profile:** After selecting the image for your web app's icon, the shortcut will create the configuration profile and prompt you to download it. Tap "Allow" then "Close."
5.  **Install the Configuration Profile:**
    * Open **Settings**. You may see a "Profile Downloaded" option near the top; tap it to go directly there.
    * If not, go to **Settings » General » VPN & Device Management**, then tap the name of your downloaded profile.
    * Tap "Install" at the top right, then enter your passcode when prompted.
    * The next page will show a message from the developer (you), outlining the last steps. Hit "Next" to continue.
    * Tap "Install" in the top right, and again at the bottom. Your profile is now installed.
6.  **Open Your New Web Clip Self-Contained App:** Find and tap the newly created web clip app icon. The website will open in its own full-screen WebView, with no navigation bars or other features obstructing your view.
7.  **Removing the Web Clip and Profile:**
    * To remove both the app and profile, go to **Settings » General » VPN & Device Management**.
    * Next, tap the profile and tap "Remove Profile."
    * You'll be prompted to enter your passcode.
    * Finally, tap "Remove" when it appears, and the profile and web clip will be deleted from your iPhone.
