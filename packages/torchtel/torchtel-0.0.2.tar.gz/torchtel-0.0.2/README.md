# torchtel

torchtel provides OpenTelemetry auto instrumentation for pytorch

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenTelemetry API
- OpenTelemetry Instrumentation â‰¥0.56b0

## Install from pypi

```bash
$ pip install torchtel
```

## Usage

### Instrument PyTorch

To instrument PyTorch, you need to import the `PyTorchInstrumentor` class, call the `instrument()` method, and register your model, see below:

```python
from torchtel import PyTorchInstrumentor

# create your PyTorch model
model = ...

# Registed the model for PyTorch Instrumentation
instrumentor = PyTorchInstrumentor().instrument(model=model)

# Run the model
...

# Uninstrument PyTorch
instrumentor.uninstrument()
```

Check out the [model example](./examples/model.py) to see OpenTelemetry autoinstrumentation in action.
