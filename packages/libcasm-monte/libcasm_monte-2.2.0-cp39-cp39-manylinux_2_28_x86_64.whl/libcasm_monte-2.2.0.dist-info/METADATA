#### libcasm-monte

The libcasm-monte package provides useful building blocks for Monte Carlo simulations. This includes:

- Sampling classes and functions
- Equilibration, convergence checking, and statistics calculation
- Generic results IO
- Supercell index conversions
- Generic event definitions, construction, and selection


#### Install

    pip install libcasm-monte


#### Usage

See the [libcasm docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/libcasm/overview/latest/).


#### About CASM

The libcasm-monte package is part of the [CASM](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_docs/) open source software package, which is designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
