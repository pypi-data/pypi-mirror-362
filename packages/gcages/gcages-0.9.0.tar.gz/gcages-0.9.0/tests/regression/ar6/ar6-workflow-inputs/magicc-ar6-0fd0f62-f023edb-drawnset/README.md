# MAGICC AR6 Probabilistic Distribution

## Description

The enclosed `.json` file contains the probabilistic distribution used in conjunction with MAGICC in AR6.
Outputs from this distribution are used in both WG1 and WG3.

## Usage

### License

The probabilistic distribution can be used in conjunction with the license conditions attached to the distribution.
The license can be found in the `license` key of the enclosed `.json` file, with the full license text in the `full_license_text` key.

### Research and educational use

If you do use the probabilistic distribution for a scientific publication or in a (non-commercial) educational context, we would greatly appreciate if you contact us as early as possible (please email Malte Meinshausen <malte.meinshausen@unimelb.edu.au>, Zebedee Nicholls <zebedee.nicholls@climate-energy-college.org> and Jared Lewis <jared.lewis@climate-resource.com>).
We make this request for two key reasons:

1. We put a huge amount of effort into developing this probabilistic distribution and we would appreciate the chance to be involved in research based on it. Most likely we will not have time to contribute in a meaningful way and so will not ask for any formal recognition, but we would appreciate at least being contacted so we can decide for ourselves.
2. We would like to keep track of where the probabilistic distribution is being used as this helps us support future users and guides our future research efforts.
3. While we are working to make MAGICC easier and easier to use, there are still many places where mistakes can be made. Running the use case past us provides an extra layer of quality control.

### Commercial use

If you wish to use the probabilistic distribution in a commercial context, please contact Zebedee Nicholls <zebedee.nicholls@climate-resource.com>.
