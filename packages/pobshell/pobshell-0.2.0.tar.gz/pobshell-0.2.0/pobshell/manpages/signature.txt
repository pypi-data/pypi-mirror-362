* For details on OPTIONS, FILTERS and TARGET 
  / ▶ signature -h 
  / ▶ man TARGET


## OPTIONS
Commonly used with mro command:
  -1             Truncate output at screenwidth, prefix each line with name
  -l             Single output line per member, not truncated at width,
                   each line prefixed with name
  -v             Multi line output per member, with banner showing Pobshell path
  -1v            Truncate output at screenwidth, prefix each line with path
  -P             Multi line output per member, with banner showing Python path

  -L N           Limit results to the first N members 
  -a             Include hidden objects
  -u             Unstyled output (no syntax highlighing, no ANSI codes)
  -r             Use Regex matching for FILTER patterns
  -i             Ignore case for FILTER patterns
  -e             Enumerate output objects for later reference


## EXAMPLES
* List signatures of callable members at current path
  / ▶ signature -1

* List the signature of a specific member
  / ▶ signature /foo/bar_func

* Search for (annotated) functions that return a bool
  / ▶ find . --signature "*->*bool*"

* Use signature as a FILTER for another command
  # Report docstring oneliners for objects that take an argument related to path
  /pandas ▶ ls -l  --signature "*path*)*" -i 
  N.B. Will match argument names as well as type annotations
