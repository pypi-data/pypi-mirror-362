# Enumerate option for Inspection commands
### -e --enumerate

Number objects in command output for quick reference. Adds a numeric index to each object listed.

- '$0', '$1', etc. refer to individual matches.
- '$$' refers to the entire enumerated set.

## NOTE  

* Further filters aren't applied to the enumerated set $$ 
	E.g. 'ls $$ --isclass' lists all of $$ not just the --isclass matches


## EXAMPLES

* List data members of current path and enumerate them
  / ▶ ls -e --isdata
  0: ast_trees   2: cursor  4: iris  6: p      8: viking_cafe
  1: connection  3: eq      5: kson  7: paths  9: x    

  * Use numbered object as TARGET
    Long listing of object number 3
    / ▶ ls -l $3
    eq  Add                       X + 1

  * Use set of numbered objects as TARGET
    Report oneline docstrings for all the data members
    / ▶ doc -1 $$
    connection   This object wraps a `sqlite3 pointer
    eq           Expression representing addition operation for algebraic group.
    iris         Container object exposing keys as attributes.
    x            Symbol class is used to create symbolic variables.


* Find objects with more than 100 attributes and enumerate them. Limit search to 5 results. Don't raise exceptions from the matchpy expression
  / ▶ find . --matchpy "len(dir(self)) > 100" -e -L 5 --noraise
  0: /apsw
  1: /ast
  2: /connection
  3: /pandas
  4: /sympy

  * Make first match the current object
    / ▶ cd $0
    /apsw ▶ 

  * List __dict__ attribute of second match
    /apsw ▶ ls -l $1/__dict__
    __dict__  dict                      {'AST': <class 'ast.AST'>, 'Add':…  

  * Report oneline docstrings for all matches 
    /apsw ▶ doc -1 $$
