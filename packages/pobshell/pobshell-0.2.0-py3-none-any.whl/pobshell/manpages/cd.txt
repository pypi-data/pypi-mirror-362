# cd command

Make object at PATH the current object

Navigate a Python object hierarchy like changing directories in a filesystem


## USAGE

/ ▶ cd PATH

Where PATH is a Linux style path, absolute or relative.

* When working with collection contents, such as list and dict items, use backticks for any "name" that's not a Python identifier  See 'man TARGET' for further info on this


## EXAMPLES

* Make root the current path
  /obj/attr ▶ cd /
  Prompt shows root is now current path:
  / ▶ 

* Make object at absolute path the current object 
  E.g. Make the time attribute of datetime module the current path (assuming datetime is in root)
    /some/path ▶  cd /datetime/time 	 
    /datetime/time ▶  

* Make a member the current object
	Depending on your map settings "Member of current path" may mean an attribute of the object at current path, and/or an item in its collection if object is a container such as a list or dict.  See map command.
  E.g. cd to 'my_list' attribute of 'obj'
    /some/obj ▶ map attributes
    /some/obj ▶ cd my_list
  E.g cd to first item in list
    /some/list ▶  map everything  # or 'map contents'
    /some/list ▶  cd `0`             

* Go up one level
  /obj/attr ▶ cd ..                   
  Prompt shows /obj is now current path:
  /obj ▶ 

* cd to member of dict having key 'os.path'
  / ▶ map everything 
  / ▶ cd /sys/modules/`'os.path'`
