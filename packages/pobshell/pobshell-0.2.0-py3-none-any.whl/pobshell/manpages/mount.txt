# mount command

'cd' to class of an object 

* Make class of a given object the current path.
  Add the class object to root, if not already present, and 'cd' to the class


## USAGE

/ ▶ mount [-h] [--alias ALIAS] [PATH]

	PATH specifies the object whose class is to be mounted.  It's Pobshell  linux-style path, absolute or relative.

	ALIAS is the name to associate with the class object in root.


* The mount command adds a class object to root, and makes it the current object.

* Mount command with no PATH lists currently mounted class objects

N.B. The 'unmount' command undoes the most recent mount command; removing the class object from root, and restoring previous current path



## EXAMPLES

* Mount class of specified object 
  / ▶ mount foo/bar
  /Bar ▶
 
* Mount class using alias
  / ▶ mount foo/bar --alias xyzzy
  /xyzzy ▶


## EXAMPLE USE CASE 
   
* Mount and then unmount the class of object viking_cafe
  /viking_cafe ▶ ls -l .
  viking_cafe  Cafe                      <__main__.Cafe object at 0x138…
  /viking_cafe ▶ mount .
  /Cafe ▶ ls -l .
  Cafe  type                      <class '__main__.Cafe'>
  /Cafe ▶ unmount
  Mounted class was removed: /Cafe 
  /viking_cafe ▶
