# **ðŸš€ Quick-Scale**  


**A SaaS starter kit for AI Engineers and Python-first developers using Django**  

Quick-Scale is designed to help **AI Engineers, Data Scientists, and Backend/Cloud developers** launch SaaS applications **quickly and efficiently**. 

It is a project generator that provides a **ready-to-use** Django-based framework with best practices for **scalability, authentication, billing, and deployment**â€”so you can focus on building your product, not setting up infrastructure.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Go from idea to paying customers with minimal setup.**  

Ideal for **solo developers** or small teams looking to turn their ideas into production-ready SaaS solutions **with minimal effort**.  

## GET STARTED ðŸ”¥ - LAUNCH QUICKLY ðŸš€

1.  Install: `pip install quickscale`
2.  Create project: `quickscale init awesome-project`
3.  Configure: Review and edit `.env` file with your settings
4.  Start: `quickscale up`
5.  Access: `http://localhost:8000`

## KEY FEATURES

- **Complete SaaS Foundation**: Authentication, user management, and **Stripe** billing integration (**in progress**)
- **Ready-to-Use Pages**: Landing, dashboard, login, signup, profile, and more
- **Modern Frontend**: HTMX and Alpine.js for dynamic interactions without complex JavaScript
- **Containerized**: Docker setup for consistent development and deployment
- **Command-Line Control**: Intuitive CLI for managing your project lifecycle
- **Starter Accounts**: Pre-configured user and admin accounts for immediate testing
- **Fail-Fast Port Validation**: Clear error messages when ports are in use, requiring explicit configuration
