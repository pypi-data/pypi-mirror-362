**forgeffects** is a Python package designed for the analysis and computation of forgotten effects and direct effects. It leverages tensor-based computations, aggregating data from multiple key informants to process chained bipartite or complete graphs using 3D tensors.


## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```         
pip install forgeffects
```

## Included Datasets

The **forgeffects** package includes three 3D incidence matrices: `CC`, `CE`, and `EE`, used in the study *Application of Forgotten Effects Theory to Evaluate Public Policy on Air Pollution in the Municipality of Valdivia, Chile*.

The data corresponds to sixteen incentives, four behaviors, and ten key informants. These matrices can be loaded using the `load_test_data()` function, which accesses `.npy` files stored in the package.

Example:

```         
import forgeffects as fe

CC = fe.load_test_data("CC.npy")
CE = fe.load_test_data("CE.npy")
EE = fe.load_test_data("EE.npy")
```

# Usage

## Graph Types

- **Complete Graphs**: To perform calculations with complete graphs, you only need to provide either the `CC` matrix (cause-cause relationships) or the `EE` matrix (effect-effect relationships). The `CE` matrix is not required for this type of graph.

- **Chained Bipartite Graphs**: To perform calculations with chained bipartite graphs, all three matrices (`CC`, `CE`, and `EE`) must be provided. These matrices represent cause-cause, cause-effect, and effect-effect relationships, respectively, and are necessary to construct the bipartite graph structure.


## Forgotten Effects

The `FE()` function identifies indirect paths between causes and effects, enabling the discovery of forgotten effects. It uses iterative max-min convolutions to analyze these paths, filtering results based on a specified significance threshold and exploring up to a defined maximum order of forgotten effects.

#### Parameters:

- `CC`: A 3D incidence matrix for cause-cause relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `CE`: A 3D incidence matrix for cause-effect relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `EE`: A 3D incidence matrix for effect-effect relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `causes`: (optional) A list or tuple of strings representing custom names for the causes. If not specified, the causes will be automatically named using the notation $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $n$ is the number of evaluated causes.
- `effects`: (optional) A list or tuple of strings representing custom names for the effects. If not specified, the effects will be automatically named using the notation $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$, where $m$ is the number of evaluated effects.
- `THR` (float): Defines the degree of truth in which incidence is considered significant within the range [0,1] (default $0.5$).
- `maxorder` (int): Maximum order of forgotten effects to compute (default $2$).
- `reps` (int): Number of replicas for empirical resampling (default $1000$).
- `device`: Supports both CPU and GPU usage (default CPU).

#### Returns:

A list of DataFrames, each corresponding to an evaluated order of forgotten effects, with the following columns:

- `From`: Origin node of the indirect relationship.
- `Through_x`: Intermediary nodes (dynamic based on the evaluated order).
- `To`: Destination node of the indirect relationship.
- `Count`: Number of times a forgotten effect is repeated across different experts.
- `Mean`: Mean of the forgotten effects identified.
- `SD`: Standard deviation.

### Example (Chained bipartite graph)

```         
import forgeffects as fe

# Compute forgotten effects
fe_results = fe.FE(CC, CE, EE, rep=10000, THR=0.5, maxorder=3)

# Display the results for the second-order forgotten effects
print(fe_results[0])

# Note: If additional orders are found, the results for
# third-order effects can be accessed using fe_results[1],
# for fourth-order effects using fe_results[2], and so on.
```

### Results

The example demonstrates the second-order forgotten effects identified by the function

## Direct Effects

The `directEffects()` function calculates direct effects by estimating mean incidences, confidence intervals, and p-values. It uses a one-sided t-test with bootstrapping to evaluate the significance of direct relationships.

#### Parameters:

- `CC`: A 3D incidence matrix for cause-cause relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `CE`: A 3D incidence matrix for cause-effect relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `EE`: A 3D incidence matrix for effect-effect relationships. This matrix must be in Numpy format with the shape (key informants, rows, columns).
- `causes`: (optional) A list or tuple of strings representing custom names for the causes. If not specified, the causes will be automatically named using the notation $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $n$ is the number of evaluated causes.
- `effects`: (optional) A list or tuple of strings representing custom names for the effects. If not specified, the effects will be automatically named using the notation $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$, where $m$ is the number of evaluated effects.
- `THR` (float): Defines the degree of truth in which incidence is considered significant within the range [0,1] (default $0.5$).
- `conf_level` (float): Confidence level for intervals (default $0.95$).
- `reps` (int): Defines the number of bootstrap replicates (default $10000$).

#### Returns:

A DataFrame with the following columns:

- `From`: Origin node of the incidence.
- `To`: Destination node of the incidence.
- `Mean`: Mean incidence across experts.
- `UCI`: Upper confidence interval limit.
- `p.value`: Calculated p-value.
