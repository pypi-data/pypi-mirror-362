    A generic Tree class for representing hierarchical data structures.
    Attributes

    self._name : name of node
    self._children : list with reference to child tree nodes

    Methods
    -------
    add_child()
        Add a child node
    set_parent()
        Set the parent node
    is_leaf()
        Check if the node is a leaf node
    get_root()
        Returns the root of the tree of node
    is_root()
        Check if node is root node

        Walks through the hole tree and yields every node
    get_tree_as_list()
        Returns the tree as nested list.
        Every index of the outer list holds the reference to tree nodes of that layer.
    equals()
        Checks if two trees are equal.
        If not, the difference is also returned as second part of tuple
    search_node_by_path()
        Searches the "nearest" existing node of a path and returns the "nearest" node
        and the missing part of the path
    add_path_to_tree()
        Adds a path (pigeonhole) to the tree
    print()
        Prints the tree
    build_ancestors_list()
        Builds the list of all ancestors for one specific node
    get_path_to_node()
        Returns the path to one specific node. Separator can be choosen.
    subtract(self, other: 'Tree') -> 'Tree':
            Subtracts another Tree from this Tree and returns the difference as a new Tree.
