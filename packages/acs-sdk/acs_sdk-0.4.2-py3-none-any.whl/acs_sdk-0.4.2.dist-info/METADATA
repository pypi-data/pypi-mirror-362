# ACS SDK for Python
The Python SDK for Accelerated Cloud Storage's Object Storage offering. 

`acs-sdk-python` is the ACS SDK for the Python programming language.

The SDK requires a minimum version of Python 3.9.

Check out the [Release Notes] for information about the latest bug fixes, updates, and features added to the SDK.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Getting Help](#getting-help)

### Python version support policy

The SDK follows a release policy of an additional six months of support for the most recently deprecated language version.

**ACS reserves the right to drop support for unsupported Python versions earlier to
address critical security issues.**

## Getting started
[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Console-blue)](https://acceleratedcloudstorage.com) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/acs-sdk) [![API Reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-Reference-blue.svg)](https://github.com/AcceleratedCloudStorage/acs-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/API.md) [![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Videos-blue.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/@AcceleratedCloudStorageSales)

#### Get credentials

Get your credentials and setup payments from the console on the [website](https://acceleratedcloudstorage.io).

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.acs/credentials``):

```
default:
    access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
```

Note: You can include multiple profiles and set them using the ACS_PROFILE environment variable. See the examples/config folder for a sample file.

#### Initialize project
Assuming that you have a supported version of Python installed, you can first set up your environment with:
```python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then, you can install acs from PyPI with:
```python
python -m pip install acs-sdk
```
Or you can install it from source (preferred option)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AcceleratedCloudStorage/acs-sdk-python
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

#### Write Code
You can either use the client for an interface similar to the AWS SDK or a FUSE mount for a file system interface. Check out the example folder or the docs folder for more details. Please refer to our benchmarks repository for comparisions against other vendors. 

## Share bucket 
You can also bring your existing buckets into the service by setting a bucket policy and then sharing the bucket with the service. 

### Step 1: Setting a bucket policy
Here is the AWS reference guide for [bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html). You can set the following bucket policy through the AWS Console or SDK to enable ACS to access it. 
```
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
    {
     "Sid": "AllowUserFullAccess", 
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::160885293701:root"
     },
     "Action": [
      "s3:*"
     ],
     "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME",
      "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME/*"
     ]
    }
   ]
}
```
### Step 2: Notify ACS of this newly shared bucket 
```
# Create a new client with the session
session = Session(region="us-east-1")
client = ACSClient(session=session)
client.share_bucket("BUCKETNAME")
```
