class LeakyBucketRateLimiter(BaseLimiter):
    """
    Implements the Leaky Bucket rate limiting algorithm.

    The Leaky Bucket algorithm models traffic flow like water in a bucket.
    Requests are "drops" added to the bucket. If the bucket overflows (exceeds capacity),
    new requests are rejected. "Water" (requests) leaks out of the bucket at a
    constant rate, making space for new requests. This algorithm is known for
    producing a smooth, constant output rate of requests, which helps in
    preventing bursts from overwhelming downstream services.

    Args:
        capacity (int): The maximum capacity of the bucket. This represents
            the maximum number of requests that can be held in the bucket
            before new requests are rejected. Must be a positive integer.
        leaks_per_second (float): The rate at which requests "leak" (are processed)
            from the bucket, in requests per second. If combined with other
            `leaks_per_*` arguments, they are summed. Defaults to 0.
        leaks_per_minute (float): The leak rate in requests per minute.
            Defaults to 0.
        leaks_per_hour (float): The leak rate in requests per hour.
            Defaults to 0.
        leaks_per_day (float): The leak rate in requests per day.
            Defaults to 0.
        key_func (Optional[Callable[[Request], str]]): An asynchronous or
            synchronous function to extract a unique key from the request.
            Defaults to client IP and path. The function should accept
            a `fastapi.Request` object and return a `str`.
        on_limit (Optional[Callable[[Request, Response, int], None]]): An
            asynchronous or synchronous function called when the rate limit is exceeded.
            Defaults to raising HTTP 429. The function should accept a
            `fastapi.Request`, `fastapi.Response`, and an `int` (retry_after seconds),
            and should not return a value.
        prefix (str): Redis key prefix for all limiter keys.
            Defaults to "cap".

    Attributes:
        capacity (int): The configured maximum bucket capacity.
        leak_rate (float): The total calculated leak rate in requests per millisecond.
        lua_script (str): The Lua script used for leaky bucket logic in Redis.
        _instance_id (str): A unique identifier for this limiter instance, used
            to create distinct Redis keys for isolation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the `capacity` is not positive, or if the total
            calculated `leak_rate` is not positive. This ensures a valid
            configuration for the leaky bucket.
