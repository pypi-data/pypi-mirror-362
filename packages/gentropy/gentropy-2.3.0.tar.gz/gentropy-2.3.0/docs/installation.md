# Installation

!!! note Python compatibility

    In the early stages of development, we are using Python version 3.10. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or similar tools to manage your local Python version. We intend to support more Python versions in the future.

## Pypi

We recommend installing Open Targets Gentropy using Pypi:

```bash
pip install gentropy
```

## Source

Alternatively, you can install Open Targets Gentropy from source. Check the [contributing](development/contributing.md) section for more information.

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall gentropy -y
```

For any issues with the installation, check the [troubleshooting section](development/troubleshooting.md).
