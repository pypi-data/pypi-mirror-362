# A command line and python package to read frequency calculation outputs or vibrational trajectories and return the internal coordinates associated with the vibration. *i.e.* a fast TS mode identification

## Installation
For now can be installed locally by:
```
git clone https://github.com/aligfellow/vib_analysis.git
cd vib_analysis
pip install .
```

## Usage
- Requires a `*trj.xyz` file
  - of the structure:
```
[n_atoms]
comment line
<atomic symbol/number> <x> <y> <z>
... ... ... ... 
```

- orca and gaussian can be parsed (using cclib) **0 indexed modes**
- orca can also be parsed separately with wrapper around orca_pltvib `--parse_orca --mode X`
  - the wrapper deals with orca printing 0 modes for linear and non-linear molecules, `--mode 0` is always the first mode
  - this separate `--parse_orca` avoids problems with cclib parsing newer orca outputs
- **atom indices are zero indexed** (though the viewer used below is *one indexed*)
- for `--parse_orca`, the path can be provided with `--orca_path`, if not provided, this will default to checking for ORCA installation with `os.system("which orca")`
     
## Improvements
### Complete
 - ~gaussian output parsing with cclib~
 - ~orca output parsing with cclib and orca_pltvib~
 - ~sort frequency printing in parse_orca where there are multiple FREQUENCY blocks~
 - ~improve/check the python interface and usage in the .ipynb examples~

### Future addition?
 - add atom symbol printing in the output

```                 
## Python interface
See examplese/examples.ipynb
This function will return a dictionary of the results, and printing can be turned on to produce the same as the CLI
For example:
```
from vib_analysis import run_vib_analysis

orca_out = 'data/bimp.out'
ORCA_PATH = os.system("which orca")
# ORCA_PATH = '/path/to/orca"

results = run_vib_analysis(
        input_file=orca_out,
        parse_orca=True,
        mode=6,
        # print_output=True,
        orca_path=ORCA_PATH,
    )

print(results)

theoretical_bond_change = (11,12)
if theoretical_bond_change in results['bond_changes']:
    print(f'True: Bond change {theoretical_bond_change} found in results.')
```
Outputs:
```
{'bond_changes': {(11, 12): (1.432, 2.064)}, 'angle_changes': {}, 'minor_angle_changes': {(13, 12, 29): (11.02, 122.116)}, 'dihedral_changes': {(31, 13, 14, 32): (29.558, 185.91), (32, 14, 15, 20): (30.937, 350.826)}, 'minor_dihedral_changes': {(2, 1, 10, 11): (35.025, 194.336), (29, 12, 13, 31): (48.971, 17.521)}, 'frame_indices': [5, 14]}
True: Bond change (11, 12) found in results.
```
  - This can be used to check for a known vibrational mode (theoretical_bond_change) in `results['bond_changes']`
  - So in theory this could identify whether the correct TS mode has been identidied in a high throughput search if the atom indices are known (or available automatically)

## Minimal Examples 
Sample python use in examples/ folder:
![sn2 imaginary mode](images/sn2.gif)
    - visualisation using [v.2.0](https://github.com/briling/v) by [**Ksenia Briling @briling**](https://github.com/briling) 
    - ```v sn2.v000.xyz``` press `f` and then `q` ; then ```convert -delay 5 -loop 0 sn2*xpm sn2.gif```

From the command line:
``` 
> vib_analysis sn2.v000.xyz
 # OR
> vib_analysis sn2.out --parse_orca --mode 0

Analysed vibrational trajectory from sn2.v000.xyz:

===== Significant Bond Changes =====
Bond (0, 4): Δ = 1.584 Å, Initial Length = 1.717 Å
Bond (0, 5): Δ = 1.356 Å, Initial Length = 1.952 Å
```
The magnitude and change (Δ) of the modes is somewhat meaningless, though this should report the initial value of the 1st frame (or reference frame).

Another example:
![dihedral imaginary mode](images/dihedral.gif)
```
> vib_analysis dihedral.v000.xyz
# OR
> vib_analysis dihedral.out --parse_orca --mode 0

Analysed vibrational trajectory from dihedral.v000.xyz:

===== Significant Dihedral Changes =====
Dihedral (6, 0, 3, 7): Δ = 39.556 degrees, Initial Value = 359.998 degrees
```

The bond changes are hierarchical, so an angle with a large change as a consequence of a bonding change is not reported as a *significant* change.

Another:
![larger molecule sn2](images/large_sn2.gif)
```
> vib_analysis large_sn2.v000.xyz

Analysed vibrational trajectory from large_sn2.v000.xyz:

===== Significant Bond Changes =====
Bond (1, 9): Δ = 1.512 Å, Initial Length = 1.668 Å
Bond (0, 1): Δ = 1.333 Å, Initial Length = 2.498 Å

===== Significant Angle Changes =====
Angle (11, 10, 12): Δ = 12.078°, Initial Value = 129.135°
```

## More detailed information
- the `--all` flag turns on reporting of coupled internal coordinate changes, including:
   - Default output:
  ```
  ===== Significant Bond Changes =====
  ===== Significant Angle Changes =====
  ===== Significant Dihedral Changes =====
  ```
    - additional output - not necessarily insignificant changes in internal coordinates but strongly coupled
  ```
  ===== Minor Angle Changes =====
  ===== Less Significant Dihedral Changes =====   
  ```
  - *i.e.* where a bond is changed, the angles around it will be altered across a vibrational trajectory and those angles would be significant enough to report as a change
  - where one of these atoms is involved in a *significant* bond change, the angle is classed as minor due to the coupled nature of the internal coordinates
     - same applies for dihedrals

## Further Examples

![bimp rearrangement](images/bimp.gif)
```
> vib_analysis bimp.v000.xyz --all #(including the flag to print all internal coordinate changes)

Analysed vibrational trajectory from bimp.v000.xyz:

===== Significant Bond Changes =====
Bond (11, 12): Δ = 1.432 Å, Initial Length = 2.064 Å

===== Significant Dihedral Changes =====
Dihedral (32, 14, 15, 20): Δ = 30.937°, Initial Value = 350.826°
Dihedral (31, 13, 14, 32): Δ = 29.557°, Initial Value = 185.910°

Note: These dihedrals are not directly dependent on other changes however they may be artefacts of other motion in the TS.

===== Minor Angle Changes =====
Angle (13, 12, 29): Δ = 11.020°, Initial Value = 122.116°

Note: These angles are dependent on other changes and may not be significant on their own.

===== Less Significant Dihedral Changes =====
Dihedral (29, 12, 13, 31): Δ = 48.971°, Initial Value = 17.521°
Dihedral (2, 1, 10, 11): Δ = 35.026°, Initial Value = 194.336°

Note: These dihedrals are dependent on other changes and may not be significant on their own.
```
![bimp rearrangement zoom](images/bimp_zoom.gif)

- correctly identifies the bond change between atoms 11 and 12
   - misses the smaller magnitude bonding change of 10 and 14 (since it is below a threshold) *see below for adjustment*
- identifies extra dihedrals for now - atoms 13, 14, 15 featured as neighbours of the bonding change
- also picking up motion of the thiourea protons that have strong NCIs with the substrate
- this may have suffered from a poor internal coordinate construction?

```
- this correctly identifies bonding changes of this transition state
- parsing the output prints the imaginary modes from the output file
- gaussian parsing (with [cclib](https://github.com/cclib/cclib) takes a *zero indexed mode* `--mode 0`

Orca output parsing is also possible with `--parse_cclib` and separately with `--parse_orca` 
  - it appears that cclib cannot yet deal with orca_6.1.0

- this *also works* using the command `vib_analysis bimp.out --parse_cclib --mode 0 --bond_threshold 0.2 --all`
  - this output used `orca_6.0.1`
