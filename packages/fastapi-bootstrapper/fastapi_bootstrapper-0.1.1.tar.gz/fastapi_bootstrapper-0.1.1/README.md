## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive CLI wizard**: Walks you through naming, location, project type, logging, and requirements.
- **LLM-ready**: Instantly add stub integrations for OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Gemini (auto-includes sample code and dependencies).
- **Custom structure**: Sets up all best-practice folders and main files‚Äîno `backend/` nesting, everything is organized at the top level.
- **Virtual environment**: Creates a fresh virtualenv for you.
- **Requirements**: Installs your dependencies; warns gracefully if any fail.
- **Logging**: Add (or skip) ready-to-use concurrent logging support.

* You‚Äôll see a summary. Hit Enter to confirm.

After it finishes, your new project will look like this:

```
myproject/

    api/
    core/
      config/
      logs/         # only if you selected logging
      services/
        llm/        # only for LLM projects
