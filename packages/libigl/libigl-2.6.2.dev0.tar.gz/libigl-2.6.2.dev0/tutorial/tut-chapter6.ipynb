    "## Subdivision surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a coarse mesh (aka cage) with vertices `V` and faces `F`, one can createa\n",
    "higher-resolution mesh with more vertices and faces by _subdividing_ every\n",
    "face. That is, each coarse triangle in the input is replaced by many smaller\n",
    "triangles. Libigl has three different methods for subdividing a triangle mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"in plane\" subdivision method will not change the point set or carrier\n",
    "surface of the mesh. New vertices are added on the planes of existing triangles\n",
    "and vertices surviving from the original mesh are not moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding new faces, a subdivision algorithm changes the _combinatorics_ of the\n",
    "mesh. The change in combinatorics and the formula for positioning the\n",
    "high-resolution vertices is called the \"subdivision rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the _in plane_ subdivision method of `igl.upsample`, vertices\n",
    "are added at the midpoint of every edge: $v_{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}(v_a + v_b)$ and\n",
    "each triangle $(i_a,i_b,i_c)$ is replaced with four triangles:\n",
    "$(i_a,i_{ab},i_{ca})$, $(i_b,i_{bc},i_{ab})$, $(i_{ab},i_{bc},i_{ca})$, and\n",
    "$(i_{bc},i_{c},i_{ca})$. This process may be applied recursively, resulting in\n",
    "a finer and finer mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subdivision method of `igl.loop` is not in plane. The vertices of the\n",
    "refined mesh are moved to weight combinations of their neighbors: the mesh is\n",
    "smoothed as it is refined <cite data-cite=\"loop_1987\">(Loop, 1987)</cite>. This and other _smooth subdivision_\n",
    "methods can be understood as generalizations of spline curves to surfaces. In\n",
    "particular the Loop subdivision method will converge to a $C^1$ surface as we\n",
    "consider the limit of recursive applications of subdivision. Away from\n",
    "\"irregular\" or \"extraordinary\" vertices (vertices of the original cage with\n",
    "valence not equal to 6), the surface is $C^2$. The combinatorics (connectivity\n",
    "and number of faces) of `igl.loop` and `igl.upsample` are identical: the only\n",
    "difference is that the vertices have been smoothed in `igl.loop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, libigl also implements a form of _in plane_ \"false barycentric\n",
    "subdivision\" in `igl.false_barycentric_subdivision`. This method simply adds\n",
    "the barycenter of every triangle as a new vertex $v_{abc}$ and replaces each\n",
    "triangle with three triangles $(i_a,i_b,i_{abc})$, $(i_b,i_c,i_{abc})$, and\n",
    "$(i_c,i_a,i_{abc})$. In contrast to `igl.upsample`, this method will create\n",
    "triangles with smaller and smaller internal angles and new vertices will sample\n",
    "the carrier surfaces with extreme bias."
