### Frontend Development

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The frontend is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Configuration

The tool stores configuration in platform-specific directories:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/amazon-q-rule-manager/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/amazon-q-rule-manager/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\amazon-q-rule-manager\`

### Environment Variables

- `AMAZONQ_RULES_URL`: Override default remote catalog URL
- `AMAZONQ_RULES_SOURCE`: Override default local source directory

## Rule Structure

Rules are stored as Markdown files with rich metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "python",
  "title": "Python Development Standards",
  "description": "Standards for Python development including version requirements and coding practices",
  "category": "python",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "tags": ["python", "development", "standards"],
  "dependencies": [],
  "conflicts": [],
  "min_python_version": "3.12",
  "supported_languages": ["python"],
  "examples": [
    "Use threading for parallel operations",
    "Always use argparse for CLI tools"
  ]
}
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zerodaysec/amazonq-rules.git
cd amazonq-rules

# Complete development setup (installs deps, hooks, syncs data)
make setup-dev

# Or manually:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
make install-hooks
make sync-frontend
```

### Development Workflow

The project includes automated syncing between the backend catalog and frontend:

1. **Automatic Sync**: When you modify `amazon_q_rule_manager/data/rules_catalog.json` or any rule files in `rules/`, the pre-commit hook automatically syncs the data to `frontend/public/`

2. **Manual Sync**: Run `make sync-frontend` to manually sync data

3. **Frontend Development**: 
   ```bash
   make dev-frontend  # Starts development server with latest data
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions**: The frontend deployment only triggers when:
   - Frontend files change (`frontend/**`)
   - Catalog data changes (`amazon_q_rule_manager/data/rules_catalog.json`)
   - Rule files change (`rules/*.md`)

### Available Make Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make sync-frontend  # Sync catalog and rules to frontend
make install-hooks  # Install Git hooks
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend dev server
make build-frontend # Build frontend for production
make test          # Run Python tests
make lint          # Run linting
make format        # Format code
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=amazon_q_rule_manager
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
make format  # Format all code
# Or manually:
black amazon_q_rule_manager/
flake8 amazon_q_rule_manager/
mypy amazon_q_rule_manager/
```

### Build Package

```bash
python -m build
```

## Backward Compatibility

The tool maintains backward compatibility with the original script:

```bash
# Legacy commands (deprecated but supported)
amazon-q-rule-manager install python /path/to/project
amazon-q-rule-manager list /path/to/project
```
