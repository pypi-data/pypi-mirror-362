Enable defining properties in conceptual data model which are not defined for any concept (dangling properties) (#1248)

# Description

This PR adds support for defining dangling properties—properties in the
conceptual data model that are not yet associated with any specific
concept.

**Justification**:
When generating a conceptual data model from an OWL ontology, it’s
common to encounter properties (e.g., owl:ObjectProperty,
owl:DatatypeProperty) that are declared but not explicitly linked to any
defined class via domain or range. Supporting dangling properties
ensures these are not lost during transformation and allows the model to
faithfully represent the source ontology structure. It also enables
incremental refinement, where associations can be added later as
understanding of the domain evolves.

**Note**: This PR is stacked on top of #1247
