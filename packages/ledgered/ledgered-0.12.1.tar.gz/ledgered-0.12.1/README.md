This repository aims at regrouping three other somehow similar yet different repositories / libraries:

- [LedgerComm](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgercomm)
- [Ledgerblue](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python) and
- [Ledgerctl](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl) (also found as LedgerWallet)


It will also contain libraries, utilitaries and other snippets useful when interfacing with Ledger
devices (NanoS, S+, X and Stax).

## Library sections
