For MGET Developers
===================

.. Note::
    These notes are still being written and may not be completely accurate. As
    of this writing in September 2024, we are in the process of moving MGET
    from our internal source code control system to GitHub. We are also
    redeveloping our build and test workflows using GitHub's automation. We
    are not ready to take pull requests from developers outside MGEL. For now,
    if you find a bug or want to suggest a code change, please open an issue.

These notes are mainly intended for MGET developers. If you just want to
install and use MGET, please see the :ref:`installation instructions
<installing-mget>`.
