GeoEco Python Package
=====================

These examples illustrate some ways to utilize MGET from Python. Unless
otherwise noted, these examples are platform-independent and do not require
ArcGIS. They are written to show how MGET can be used from a Python script,
notebook, or REPL (including the ArcGIS Python window, if desired). They make
use of MGET's :doc:`Public API <PublicAPI>` and occasionally some functions in
the :doc:`Internal API <InternalAPI>`, mainly to configure logging.

    We will incorporate additional examples as we continue to port MGET to
    Python 3.x.
