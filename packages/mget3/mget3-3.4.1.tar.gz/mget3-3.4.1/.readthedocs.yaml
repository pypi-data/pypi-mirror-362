  # To build the documentation, our package (GeoEco) must be installed.
  # But we don't want to install all of its dependencies, and we want.
  # to install it as an editable install. Unfortunately we can't do that
  # with python.install below, e.g. using method: pip. So do it with a
  # post_install job here.

    post_install:
    - python -m pip install --no-deps -e .

# Build documentation in the "doc/GeoEco" directory with Sphinx
