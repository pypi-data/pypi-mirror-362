 # Always Use UV for Python

This project uses `uv` as the Python package manager and environment tool. Follow these guidelines:

## Package Management

- To add new dependencies:
  ```bash
  uv add package_name
  ```

- To update the environment with dependencies from requirements.txt:
  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```

## Running Python Code

- Always use `uv run` to execute Python files:
  ```bash
  uv run myfile.py
  ```

## Benefits of UV

- Faster than pip
- Better dependency resolution
- Built-in virtual environment management

## Common Commands

- Install a package: `uv add package_name`
- Update or install dependencies: `uv sync`
- Run Python file: `uv run file.py`
- Create new venv: `uv venv`
