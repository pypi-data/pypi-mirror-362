# pytest-unmagic

Pytest fixtures with conventional import semantics.

## Installation

```sh
pip install pytest-unmagic
```

## Usage

Define fixtures with the `unmagic.fixture` decorator, and apply them to other
fixtures or test functions with `unmagic.use`.

```py
from unmagic import fixture, use

traces = []

@fixture
def tracer():
    assert not traces, f"unexpected traces before setup: {traces}"
    yield
    traces.clear()

@use(tracer)
def test_append():
    traces.append("hello")
    assert traces, "expected at least one trace"
```

A fixture must yield exactly once. The `@use` decorator causes the fixture to be
set up and registered for tear down, but does not pass the yielded value to the
decorated function. This is appropriate for fixtures that have side effects.

The location where a fixture is defined has no affect on where it can be used.
Any code that can import it can use it as long as it is executed in the context
of running tests and does not violate scope restrictions.

### @use shorthand

If a single fixture is being applied to another fixture or test it may be
applied directly as a decorator without `@use()`. The test in the example above
could have been written as

```py
@tracer
def test_append():
    traces.append("hello")
    assert traces, "expected at least one trace"
```

### Applying fixtures to test classes

The `@use` decorator can be used on test classes, which applies the fixture(s)
to every test in the class.

```py
@use(tracer)
class TestClass:
    def test_galaxy(self):
        traces.append("Is anybody out there?")
```

#### Unmagic fixtures on `unittest.TestCase` tests

Unlike standard pytest fixtures, unmagic fixtures can be applied directly to
`unittest.TestCase` tests.

### Call a fixture to retrieve its value

The value of a fixture can be retrieved within a test function or other fixture
by calling the fixture. This is similar to `request.getfixturevalue()`.

```py
@fixture
def tracer():
    assert not traces, f"unexpected traces before setup: {traces}"
    yield traces
    traces.clear()

def test_append():
    traces = tracer()
    traces.append("hello")
    assert traces, "expected at least one trace"
```

### Fixture scope

Fixtures may declare a `scope` of `'function'` (the default), `'class'`,
`'module'`, `'package'`, or `'session'`. A fixture will be torn down after all
tests in its scope have run if any in-scope tests used the fixture.

```py
@fixture(scope="class")
def tracer():
    traces = []
    yield traces
    assert traces, "expected at least one trace"
```

### Autouse fixtures

Fixtures may be applied to tests automatically with `@fixture(autouse=...)`. The
value of the `autouse` parameter may be one of

- A test module or package path (usually `__file__`) to apply the fixture to all
  tests within the module or package.
- `True`: apply the fixture to all tests in the session.

A single fixture may be registered for autouse in multiple modules and packages
with ``unmagic.autouse``.

```py
# tests/fixtures.py
from unmagic import fixture

@fixture
def a_fixture():
    ...


# tests/test_this.py
from unmagic import autouse
from .fixtures import a_fixture

autouse(a_fixture, __file__)

...


# tests/test_that.py
from unmagic import autouse
from .fixtures import a_fixture

autouse(a_fixture, __file__)

...
```

### Magic fixture fence

It is possible to errect a fence around tests in a particular module or package
to ensure that magic fixtures are not used in that namespace except with the
`@use(...)` decorator.

```py
from unmagic import fence

fence.install(['mypackage.tests'])
```

This will cause warnings to be emitted for magic fixture usages within
`mypackage.tests`.


### Accessing the pytest request object

The `unmagic.get_request()` function provides access to the test request object.
Among other things, it can be used to retrieve fixtures defined with
`@pytest.fixture`.

```py
from unmagic import get_request

def test_output():
    capsys = get_request().getfixturevalue("capsys")
    print("hello")
    captured = capsys.readouterr()
    assert captured.out == "hello\n"
```

### `@use` pytest fixtures

Fixtures defined with `@pytest.fixture` can be applied to a test or other
fixture by passing the fixture name to `@use`. None of the built-in fixtures
provided by pytest make sense to use this way, but it is a useful technique for
fixtures that have side effects, such as pytest-django's `db` fixture.

```py
from unmagic import use

@use("db")
def test_database():
    ...
```

### Chaining fixtures

Fixtures that use other fixtures should be decorated with `@use`, so
that fixture dependencies are chained.

```python
@use("db")
def parent_fixture():
    daedalus = Person.objects.create(name='Daedalus')
    yield daedalus
    daedalus.delete()

@use(parent_fixture)
@fixture
def child_fixture():
    daedalus = parent_fixture()
    icarus = Person.objects.create(name='Icarus', father=daedalus)
    yield

@use(child_fixture)
def test_flight():
    flyers = Person.objects.all()
    ...
```


## Running the `unmagic` test suite

```sh
cd path/to/pytest-unmagic
pip install -e .
pytest
```


## Publishing a new verison to PyPI

Push a new tag to Github using the format vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z matches the version
in [`__init__.py`](src/unmagic/__init__.py).

A new version is published to https://test.pypi.org/p/pytest-unmagic on every
push to the *main* branch.

Publishing is automated with [Github Actions](.github/workflows/pypi.yml).
