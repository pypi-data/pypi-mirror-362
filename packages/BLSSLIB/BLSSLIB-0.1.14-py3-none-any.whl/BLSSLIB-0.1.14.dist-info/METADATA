Functions
BLSSLIB.DecodeBlockItem(raw:str) -> dict
    - raw : is the raw string of a block item that is not in a save of any kind or is in relation to another block (ie it is not wired)

    OUTPUT:
    a python dict that contains the basic data of the block
    id : its name in the game like block or EEPROM
    position : the x y and z of the block if it is a multiblock then its made location ie form were it was placed from will be shown 
    colour : the rgb colour (can some times not exist for components but this is for block only)
    rotation : a chr showing the 1 ofr 24 rotation values

BLSSLIB.DecodeBlockSave(save : str) -> list[dict[str:str]]
    basicly splits by the ; and does the DecodeBlockItem on each block

BLSSLIB.EncodeBlockItem(block:dict) -> str
    does the opposit of the BLSSLIB.DecodeBlockItem()

BLSSLIB.EncodeBlockSave(blocks:list[dict[str:str]]) -> str
    taskes each dict of block data convets to save steign and adds a ; to it and repeat

BLSSLIB.addEeprom8(data:list[int|str], world: list[dict[str:str]], position: tuple[int, int, int], rotation: str) -> dict
    so takes in data that is converted into a eeprom at 0 0 0 with a function then it extracts the data part of the eeprom save and puts it in a new empty eeprom at position and rotation it also raises a error if the positon .. +1 to z .. ... .. +8 to z is any of those positon are alredy in the world (defined later)

    world is a list of the dict of your decoded save you are likely to have this as when you decode a save you get a list of dict that you edit and use to sore the save to be further Encoded
