      "Abstract: One key reason for T cell exhaustion is continuous antigen exposure. Early exhausted T cells can reverse exhaustion and differentiate into fully functional memory T cells if removed from persisting antigen stimulation. Therefore, this study viewed T cell exhaustion as an over-activation status induced by chronic antigen stimuli. This study hypothesized that blocking TCR signal intermittently to terminate over-activation signal can defer the developmental process of T cell exhaustion. In this study, melanoma-bearing mice were treated with tacrolimus (FK506) every 5 days. The tumor size and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were analyzed. We found that intermittent administration of tacrolimus significantly inhibited tumor growth, and this effect was mediated by CD8+T cells. Intermittent tacrolimus treatment facilitated the infiltration of CD8+TILs. RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR of sorted CD8+TILs showed the expression of Nr4a1 (an exhaustion-related transcription factor) and Ctla4 (a T cell inhibitory receptor) was remarkably downregulated. These results indicated that intermittently blocking TCR signal by tacrolimus can promote anti-tumor immunity and inhibit the tumor growth in melanoma-bearing mice, inhibiting the transcription of several exhaustion-related genes, such as Nr4a1 and Ctla4.\n",

      "Abstract: Exhaustion is a dysfunctional state of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTL) observed in chronic infection and cancer. Current in vivo models of CTL exhaustion using chronic viral infections or cancer yield very few exhausted CTL, limiting the analysis that can be done on these cells. Establishing an in vitro system that rapidly induces CTL exhaustion would therefore greatly facilitate the study of this phenotype, identify the truly exhaustion-associated changes and allow the testing of novel approaches to reverse or prevent exhaustion. Here we show that repeat stimulation of purified TCR transgenic OT-I CTL with their specific peptide induces all the functional (reduced cytokine production and polyfunctionality, decreased in vivo expansion capacity) and phenotypic (increased inhibitory receptors expression and transcription factor changes) characteristics of exhaustion. Importantly, in vitro exhausted cells shared the transcriptomic characteristics of the gold standard of exhaustion, CTL from LCMV cl13 infections. Gene expression of both in vitro and in vivo exhausted CTL was distinct from T cell anergy. Using this system, we show that Tcf7 promoter DNA methylation contributes to TCF1 downregulation in exhausted CTL. Thus this novel in vitro system can be used to identify genes and signaling pathways involved in exhaustion and will facilitate the screening of reagents that prevent/reverse CTL exhaustion.\n",

      "Title: TIM-3 Suppresses Anti-CD3/CD28-Induced TCR Activation and IL-2 Expression through the NFAT Signaling Pathway.\n",
      "Abstract: TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3) is a member of the TIM family of proteins that is preferentially expressed on Th1 polarized CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent studies indicate that TIM-3 serves as a negative regulator of T cell function (i.e. T cell dependent immune responses, proliferation, tolerance, and exhaustion). Despite having no recognizable inhibitory signaling motifs, the intracellular tail of TIM-3 is apparently indispensable for function. Specifically, the conserved residues Y265/Y272 and surrounding amino acids appear to be critical for function. Mechanistically, several studies suggest that TIM-3 can associate with interleukin inducible T cell kinase (ITK), the Src kinases Fyn and Lck, and the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) adaptor protein to positively or negatively regulate IL-2 production via NF-ÎºB/NFAT signaling pathways. To begin to address this discrepancy, we examined the effect of TIM-3 in two model systems. First, we generated several Jurkat T cell lines stably expressing human TIM-3 or murine CD28-ECD/human TIM-3 intracellular tail chimeras and examined the effects that TIM-3 exerts on T cell Receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, cytokine secretion, promoter activity, and protein kinase association. In this model, our results demonstrate that TIM-3 inhibits several TCR-mediated phenotypes: i) NF-kB/NFAT activation, ii) CD69 expression, and iii) suppression of IL-2 secretion. To confirm our Jurkat cell observations we developed a primary human CD8+ cell system that expresses endogenous levels of TIM-3. Upon TCR ligation, we observed the loss of NFAT reporter activity and IL-2 secretion, and identified the association of Src kinase Lck, and PLC-Î³ with TIM-3. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that TIM-3 is a negative regulator of TCR-function by attenuating activation signals mediated by CD3/CD28 co-stimulation.\n",

      "Title: Acute Viral Respiratory Infection Rapidly Induces a CD8+ T Cell Exhaustion-like Phenotype.\n",
      "Abstract: Acute viral infections typically generate functional effector CD8(+) T cells (TCD8) that aid in pathogen clearance. However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection, lung TCD8 are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to Ag during chronic infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to TCD8 impairment during viral lower respiratory infection, but how it regulates TCD8 impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections are unknown. In this study, we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung TCD8. In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung TCD8 to functional spleen TCD8 in the same human metapneumovirus-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung TCD8. We then compared the gene expression of TCD8 during human metapneumovirus infection to those in acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung TCD8 more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than do functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for TCD8 impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral Ag-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral Ag in infected lungs rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung TCD8 characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors.\n",

      "<observation>Title: TIM-3 Suppresses Anti-CD3/CD28-Induced TCR Activation and IL-2 Expression through the NFAT Signaling Pathway.\n",
      "Abstract: TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3) is a member of the TIM family of proteins that is preferentially expressed on Th1 polarized CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent studies indicate that TIM-3 serves as a negative regulator of T cell function (i.e. T cell dependent immune responses, proliferation, tolerance, and exhaustion). Despite having no recognizable inhibitory signaling motifs, the intracellular tail of TIM-3 is apparently indispensable for function. Specifically, the conserved residues Y265/Y272 and surrounding amino acids appear to be critical for function. Mechanistically, several studies suggest that TIM-3 can associate with interleukin inducible T cell kinase (ITK), the Src kinases Fyn and Lck, and the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) adaptor protein to positively or negatively regulate IL-2 production via NF-ÎºB/NFAT signaling pathways. To begin to address this discrepancy, we examined the effect of TIM-3 in two model systems. First, we generated several Jurkat T cell lines stably expressing human TIM-3 or murine CD28-ECD/human TIM-3 intracellular tail chimeras and examined the effects that TIM-3 exerts on T cell Receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, cytokine secretion, promoter activity, and protein kinase association. In this model, our results demonstrate that TIM-3 inhibits several TCR-mediated phenotypes: i) NF-kB/NFAT activation, ii) CD69 expression, and iii) suppression of IL-2 secretion. To confirm our Jurkat cell observations we developed a primary human CD8+ cell system that expresses endogenous levels of TIM-3. Upon TCR ligation, we observed the loss of NFAT reporter activity and IL-2 secretion, and identified the association of Src kinase Lck, and PLC-Î³ with TIM-3. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that TIM-3 is a negative regulator of TCR-function by attenuating activation signals mediated by CD3/CD28 co-stimulation.\n",

      "Title: Acute Viral Respiratory Infection Rapidly Induces a CD8+ T Cell Exhaustion-like Phenotype.\n",
      "Abstract: Acute viral infections typically generate functional effector CD8(+) T cells (TCD8) that aid in pathogen clearance. However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection, lung TCD8 are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to Ag during chronic infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to TCD8 impairment during viral lower respiratory infection, but how it regulates TCD8 impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections are unknown. In this study, we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung TCD8. In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung TCD8 to functional spleen TCD8 in the same human metapneumovirus-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung TCD8. We then compared the gene expression of TCD8 during human metapneumovirus infection to those in acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung TCD8 more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than do functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for TCD8 impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral Ag-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral Ag in infected lungs rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung TCD8 characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors.\n",

      "Title: The transcription factor NFAT promotes exhaustion of activated CD8âº T cells.\n",
      "Abstract: During persistent antigen stimulation, CD8(+) T cells show a gradual decrease in effector function, referred to as exhaustion, which impairs responses in the setting of tumors and infections. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor NFAT controls the program of T cell exhaustion. When expressed in cells, an engineered form of NFAT1 unable to interact with AP-1 transcription factors diminished T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, increased the expression of inhibitory cell surface receptors, and interfered with the ability of CD8(+) T cells to protect against Listeria infection and attenuate tumor growth in vivo. We defined the genomic regions occupied by endogenous and engineered NFAT1 in primary CD8(+) T cells and showed that genes directly induced by the engineered NFAT1 overlapped with genes expressed in exhausted CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Our data show that NFAT promotes T cell anergy and exhaustion by binding at sites that do not require cooperation with AP-1.\n",

      "Title: Transcriptional analysis of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells shows that PD-1 inhibits T cell function by upregulating BATF.\n",
      "Abstract: CD8(+) T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8(+) T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes--such as BATF--that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV.\n",

      "Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) represents a profoundly invasive malignancy of the skeletal system. T cell exhaustion (Tex) is known to facilitate immunosuppression and tumor progression, but its role in OS remains unclear. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing data was employed to identify exhausted T cells within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of OS. We found that exhausted T cells exhibited substantial infiltration in OS samples. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed a progressive increase in the expression of various Tex marker genes, including PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, ENTPD1, and HAVCR2 in OS. GSVA showed that apoptosis, fatty acid metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, and the interferon pathway were significantly activated in exhausted T cells in OS. Subsequently, a prognostic model was constructed using two Tex-specific genes, MYC and FCGR2B, which exhibited exceptional prognostic accuracy in two independent cohorts. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that OS patients with a low Tex risk were responsive to Dasatinib and Pazopanib. Finally, immunohistochemistry verified that MYC and FCGR2B were significantly upregulated in OS tissues compared with adjacent tissues. This study investigates the role of Tex within the TIME of OS, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying disease progression as well as the potential treatment strategies for OS.\n",

      "Abstract: Decoding the clinical impact of genetic variants is particularly important for precision medicine in cancer. Genetic screening of mainly breast and ovarian cancer patients has identified numerous BRCA1/BRCA2 'variants of uncertain significance' (VUS) that remain unclassified due to a lack of pedigrees and functional data.\n",
      "Here, we used CRISPR-Select - a technology that exploits unique inbuilt controls at the endogenous locus - to assess 54 rare ClinVar VUS located in the PALB2-binding domain (PBD) of BRCA2. Variant deleteriousness was examined in the absence and presence of PARPi, Cisplatin, or Mitomycin C.\n",
      "Marked functional deficiency was observed for variants in the exon 2-donor splice region (A22 = (c.66A>C), A22 = (c.66A>G), A22 = (c.66A>T), and D23H) and Trp31 amino acid (W31G, W31L, and W31C), both critical for BRCA2 function. Moreover, T10K and G25R resulted in an intermediate phenotype, suggesting these variants are hypomorphic in nature. Combining our functional results with the latest ClinGen BRCA1/2 Variant Curation Expert Panel recommendations, we could classify 49 of the 54 VUS as either likely benign (n = 45) or likely pathogenic (n = 4).\n",

      "Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a condition caused by interstitial infiltration of misfolded proteins structured into amyloid fibrils. Transthyretin (ATTR) and immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis represent the most common forms of CA. CA was traditionally perceived as a rare and incurable disease, but diagnostic and therapeutic advances have undermined the conventional paradigm.\n",
      "The standard of care for ATTR-CA include agents capable of selectively stabilizing the precursor protein (e.g., tafamidis), whereas the plasma cell clone is the main target of chemotherapy for AL-CA. For long, tafamidis represented the only drug approved for patients with ATTR-CA. Recent data from ATTRibute-CM led to the approval of acoramidis, whereas patisiran received refusal based on the APOLLO-B trial. Novel CRISPR-Cas9-based drugs (i.e., NTLA-2001) hold great potential in the setting of ATTR-CA. Several hematological regimens are available to treat AL-CA. The main limit of current therapies is their inability to trigger removal of amyloid from tissues. However, the investigation of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded ATTR (e.g., PRX004, NI301A) or AL (e.g., birtamimab, anselamimab) has led to encouraging results. Various cutting-edge strategies are being tested for treatment of CA and may change the prognostic landscape of this condition in the next years.\n",

We identified conserved regions in the Influenza B Virus (IBV) NS gene and designed forward and reverse primers along with crRNAs. We then established and optimised the reaction system, and Nucleic Acid Positive Reference Materials of IBV were used to evaluate the detection limit (DL) of CRISPRET. Additionally, we collected 257 clinical samples, comprising 127 samples from patients with IBV infection and 130 samples from healthy individuals, and subjected them to dual detection using CRISPRET and qPCR to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of CRISPRET.

      "Abstract: The efficient and stable production of therapeutic proteins in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells hinges on robust cell line development (CLD). Traditional methods relying on random transgene integration often result in clonal variability, requiring extensive and resource-intensive screening. To address this limitation, we established a systematic, multiomics-driven framework that integrates 202 RNA-sequencing datasets and whole-genome sequencing data to identify genomic \"hotspot\" loci for precise and high-yield transgene integration. From an initial pool of 20 candidate loci, 5 top-performing hotspots were validated using site-specific integration in CHO-DG44 cells via the CRISPR/Cas9 system with Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). These genomic hotspots achieved 2.2- to 15.0-fold higher relative specific productivity compared to previously known controls (Fer1L4 and Locus1 sites), across multiple therapeutic proteins, including a lysosomal storage disorder-related enzyme and an Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-related monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression. This study offers a transformative approach to CLD, achieving significant improvements in productivity, genomic stability, and efficiency, as well as paving the way for enhanced biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\n",

Surfactants enhance drug solubility, enhance targeted delivery, and facilitate controlled release of drugs. Their antimicrobial action is a result of their ability to disrupt microbial membranes, and their application in the delivery of genes and proteins involves stabilizing lipid nanoparticles for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Surfactants also assist in biomedical imaging and theranostics by enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast, fluorescence bioimaging, and cancer diagnosis. In tissue engineering, they assist in the manufacturing of scaffolds and coatings of biomaterials. In spite of their broad application, cytotoxicity concerns, environmental impact, and regulatory constraints bar clinical use. Biodegradable biosurfactants, stimuli-responsive intelligent surfactants, and AI-driven formulation design are areas that future studies can focus on to enhance safety and effectiveness in current healthcare applications.\n",

      "Based on our previous CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified SMARCD1, a subunit of the mating-type switching/sucrose fermentation (SWI/SNF) complex, as a factor that promotes tumor evasion by inducing PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint responses. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was used to assess SMARCD1 expression levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal tissues. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was employed to generate SMARCD1 knockout (KO) cell lines. Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to evaluate PD-L1 expression. Cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were also assessed. A tumor model was established to examine the in vivo effects of SMARCD1. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses were conducted to investigate the potential mechanisms.\n",
      "SMARCD1 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues. In vitro, SMARCD1 regulated PD-L1 expression and significantly promoted tumor growth. The SWI/SNF inhibitor FHT-1015 reversed the effects of SMARCD1 knockout.
