def delay(milliseconds: int) -> None:
    """
    Delay the program execution for the specified duration.
    
    This function pauses execution for the given number of milliseconds.
    Useful for simple timing control, though using Clock.tick() is generally
    preferred for frame rate control.
    
    Args:
        milliseconds (int): The number of milliseconds to delay.
    """
def get_elapsed_time() -> float:
    """
    Get the elapsed time since the program started.
    
    Returns:
        float: The total elapsed time since program start, in seconds.
    """
