policy.py - Geofence Policy Logic and Implementations.

This module provides the core components for defining and evaluating geofencing
policies. The design prioritizes clarity, immutability, and strict adherence
to the principle of least surprise, which are critical for any system used in a
compliance or security context.

The core components are:
1.  `Policy (ABC)`: An abstract base class that defines the contract for all
    policy implementations. It guarantees that any policy will have an
    `is_allowed` method.

2.  `PolicyRule (Enum)`: A type-safe enumeration of the supported policy rules,
    preventing the use of arbitrary "magic strings" in the codebase.

3.  `WhitelistPolicy` & `BlacklistPolicy`: Concrete, immutable implementations
    of the `Policy` contract. These are implemented as frozen dataclasses to
    ensure that a policy's configuration cannot be accidentally modified at
    runtime.

4.  `get_policy()`: A factory function that serves as the public entry point
    for creating policy objects from simple string identifiers and a set of
    country codes.

A key design decision is the explicit and strict handling of unresolved IP
addresses (where the resolved country is `None`):
-   **WhitelistPolicy**: If a country is `None`, access is DENIED. The logic is
    "allow ONLY if the location is on the list." An unknown location cannot
    be on the list.
-   **BlacklistPolicy**: If a country is `None`, access is ALLOWED. The logic is
    "deny ONLY if the location is on the list." An unknown location cannot
    be on the blocklist, so access is permitted by default.

This deterministic behavior is crucial for auditable and predictable systems.
