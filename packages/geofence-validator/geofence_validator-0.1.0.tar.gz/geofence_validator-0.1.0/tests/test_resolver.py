"""
test_resolver.py - Unit Tests for the IP-to-Country Resolver.

This suite provides exhaustive testing for the `InMemoryResolver`, which is a
critical component involving file I/O, data parsing, and IP address logic.

The tests are structured as follows:
1.  **Fixtures**: A `test_data_dir` fixture creates a temporary directory and
    populates it with a variety of test CSV files:
    - A perfectly valid data file.
    - Files with specific errors (bad CIDR, bad format).
    - Files representing edge cases (empty, comments).

2.  **`TestInMemoryResolverInitialization`**: Focuses solely on the `__init__`
    method. It tests that the resolver can be created successfully with valid
    data and that it raises the correct, specific `ResolverInitializationError`
    for every conceivable type of malformed input file.

3.  **`TestInMemoryResolverResolution`**: Assumes a correctly initialized
    resolver. It tests the `resolve` method itself, verifying:
    - Correct resolution of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    - Correct raising of `IPAddressNotFoundError` for unknown public IPs.
    - Correct raising of `InvalidIPAddressError` for malformed IP strings.
    - Correct raising of `NonPublicIPAddressError` for all categories of
      reserved IP addresses (private, loopback, link-local, etc.).
