"""
test_core.py - Unit and Integration Tests for the Core Validation Logic.

This suite validates the `core` module, which orchestrates the policy and
resolver components.

Testing Strategy:
1.  **Mocking the Resolver**: We use a mock resolver (`MockResolver`) to test
    the `Validator` class and `is_ip_allowed` function in isolation. This allows
    us to simulate any possible outcome from the resolution step (e.g., finding
    a country, not finding one, raising a specific error) without any dependency
    on the actual `InMemoryResolver` or the file system. This ensures our tests
    are fast, deterministic, and true unit tests of the orchestration logic.

2.  **Testing Both APIs**: Separate test classes are used for the `Validator`
    class and the `is_ip_allowed` functional wrapper to ensure both public
    APIs are working as intended.

3.  **Thread-Safety Verification**: A dedicated test, `test_default_resolver_is_thread_safe`,
    is included to prove that the lazy initialization of the default resolver
    is safe from race conditions. This is a critical test for a library
    intended for use in production server environments. It patches the
    `InMemoryResolver` to count how many times its expensive constructor is
    called, asserting it is only ever `1` even when accessed by many threads
    concurrently.
