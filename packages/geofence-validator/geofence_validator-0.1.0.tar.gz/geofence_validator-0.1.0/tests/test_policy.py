"""
test_policy.py - Unit Tests for the Geofence Policy Logic.

This test suite exhaustively covers the behavior of the policy module, ensuring
that the core logic of the library is sound, predictable, and correct.

The tests are structured into classes for each major component being tested:
- `TestWhitelistPolicy`: Verifies all logical paths for the whitelist rule.
- `TestBlacklistPolicy`: Verifies all logical paths for the blacklist rule.
- `TestPolicyFactory`: Verifies the `get_policy` factory function, including
  its validation of rule names and policy definitions.

We use `pytest.mark.parametrize` extensively to test a wide range of scenarios
(different countries, `None` values) with concise, readable code. This approach
ensures that we are not just testing the "happy path," but are explicitly
verifying every documented edge case.
