"""
errors.py - Custom Exception Hierarchy for the Geofence Validator Library.

This module defines a structured set of custom exceptions that are raised by
the geofence_validator library. By providing a clear hierarchy, consuming code
can perform fine-grained error handling, distinguishing between different
classes of failures such as input validation, IP resolution issues, and policy
configuration problems.

All exceptions in this library inherit from a single base class, `GeofenceError`.
This allows users to catch any library-specific error with a single
`except GeofenceError:` block if they choose to.

The hierarchy is designed to be both informative and actionable:
- GeofenceError (Base for all library exceptions)
  - ValidationError (Category for malformed or invalid user inputs)
    - InvalidIPAddressError (Input is not a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address)
    - NonPublicIPAddressError (IP is valid but reserved, private, or loopback)
    - InvalidCountryCodeError (Country code is not a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
    - InvalidPolicyRuleError (Policy rule string is not recognized)
  - ResolutionError (Category for failures during the IP-to-country lookup)
    - IPResolutionFailedError (A generic failure occurred in the resolver)
    - IPAddressNotFoundError (The IP is valid but not found in the lookup data)
  - PolicyError (Category for logical errors in policy definition)
    - InvalidPolicyDefinitionError (A policy is configured incorrectly)
  - ConfigurationError (Category for setup or initialization problems)
    - ResolverInitializationError (The resolver could not be initialized)

Each exception class carries context-specific information, such as the invalid
value that caused the error, making debugging and logging far more effective.
