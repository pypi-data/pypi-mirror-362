"""
core.py - The main engine and user-facing API for the geofence-validator.

This module provides the `Validator` class, which is the high-performance,
reusable engine for all geofencing operations. It is designed to be
instantiated once with a specific policy and then used repeatedly to check
numerous IP addresses, amortizing the initial setup cost.

For convenience, a simple functional wrapper, `is_ip_allowed`, is also provided
for one-off checks.

**Design Philosophy**

1.  **Object-Oriented Core (`Validator` class)**: Encapsulates the complete
    validation context (resolver and policy). This makes state explicit and
    avoids re-creating policy objects on every call, leading to significant
    performance gains in real-world applications.

2.  **Thread-Safe Lazy Initialization**: The default `InMemoryResolver`, which is
    expensive to create due to file I/O and parsing, is initialized only once
    when first needed. The initialization is protected by a `threading.Lock`
    to ensure it is safe to use in multi-threaded environments without race
    conditions.

3.  **Facade for Simplicity (`is_ip_allowed` function)**: Retains a simple,
    procedural entry point for users who only need to perform a single check.
    This function is a thin wrapper around the `Validator` class.

This combination of a powerful, reusable class and a simple functional facade
provides both performance for power users and ease of use for simple cases.
