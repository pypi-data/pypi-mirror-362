```python
from characterai_tts import TTS
# Create a client (default voice ‚Äì your_voice_id)
client = TTS(api_token="CHARACTER_AI_TOKEN", voice="your_voice_id")
# Speak with the default voice and save to file
client.say("This is an example created with this class")
```
Note: Sometimes CharacterTTS may not synthesize your expected text. This issue is being worked on.
