**pixi-to-conda-lock** is a Python utility designed to bridge the gap between the lightning-fast `pixi lock` and the traditionally slow generation of `conda-lock` files.
By converting your fast-generated `pixi.lock` file into a fully functional `conda-lock.yml`,  you can enjoy rapid lock file creation without sacrificing the reproducibility of your conda environments. 🚀

## :star2: Features

- **Speed Boost:** Generate a `conda-lock.yml` file quickly by leveraging the performance of `pixi lock`.
- **Accurate Conversion:** Uses repodata to extract detailed package metadata from your `pixi.lock` file.
- **Multi-Environment Support:** Convert all environments in your pixi.lock file or select specific ones.
- **Multi-Manager Support:** Handles both conda and PyPI packages, ensuring comprehensive environment reproduction.
- **Fully Tested:** Comprehensive tests ensure robust and reliable behavior.
- **Typed & Readable:** Written in Python with full type annotations for clarity and maintainability.

## :books: Usage

Transform your fast-generated `pixi.lock` file into reproducible conda lock files with a single command:

```bash
pixi-to-conda-lock --help
```

This will display the help message:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- pixi-to-conda-lock --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
usage: pixi-to-conda-lock [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--environment ENVIRONMENT]
                          [--verbose]
                          pixi_lock

Convert pixi.lock to conda-lock.yml

positional arguments:
  pixi_lock             Path to pixi.lock file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output, -o OUTPUT   Output directory for conda-lock files (default:
                        current directory)
  --environment, -e ENVIRONMENT
                        Specific environment to convert (default: convert all
                        environments)
  --verbose, -v         Enable verbose logging
```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

Install **pixi-to-conda-lock** via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pixi-to-conda-lock):

```bash
pip install pixi-to-conda-lock
```

Or clone the repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basnijholt/pixi-to-conda-lock.git
cd pixi-to-conda-lock
pip install .
```

## :bulb: Examples

### Basic Conversion

Convert all environments in your `pixi.lock` file to conda-lock files:

```bash
pixi-to-conda-lock /path/to/pixi.lock
```

This will generate:
- `conda-lock.yml` for the default environment
- `<env_name>.conda-lock.yml` for each additional environment

### Converting a Specific Environment

Convert only a specific environment from your pixi.lock file:

```bash
pixi-to-conda-lock /path/to/pixi.lock --environment dev
```

This will generate only `dev.conda-lock.yml` (or `conda-lock.yml` if the environment is "default").

### Specifying an Output Directory

Save the generated conda-lock files to a specific directory:

```bash
pixi-to-conda-lock /path/to/pixi.lock --output /path/to/output/dir
```

### Enable Verbose Logging

To see detailed logs during the conversion process:

```bash
pixi-to-conda-lock /path/to/pixi.lock --verbose
```

## :page_facing_up: How It Works

1. **Fast pixi.lock Parsing:** Reads the fast-generated `pixi.lock` file, which is created quickly compared to generating a conda lock file directly.
2. **Environment Detection:** Identifies all environments defined in the pixi.lock file or processes only the specified environment.
3. **Repodata Loading:** Retrieves detailed package metadata from repodata files (either automatically discovered or from a user-specified directory).
4. **Package Processing:** Processes both conda and PyPI packages for each environment. For conda packages, if repodata information isn't available, the tool falls back on URL parsing.
5. **Generating conda-lock.yml:** Combines the gathered information to generate fully reproducible conda-lock files that mirror your original environments.

This approach ensures you get the speed benefits of `pixi lock` without compromising on the quality and reproducibility of your conda environments.
