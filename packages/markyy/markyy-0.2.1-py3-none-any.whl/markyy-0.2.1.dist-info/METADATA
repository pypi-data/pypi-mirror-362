# Marky

Marky is a minimal terminal-based Markdown editor built with Python 3 and `ncurses`. It offers a clean editing experience with live syntax highlighting, autosave, and in-terminal search — all inside your terminal window.

---

## Features

- Markdown syntax highlighting (headers, bold, italic, code, lists, links, etc.)
- Live character count in the footer
- Header/footer UI with consistent styling
- Autosave every 30 seconds with a `.bak` backup file
- Flash message confirmation after autosave
- In-editor search (`Ctrl+F`) with next (`Ctrl+N`) and previous (`Ctrl+P`) navigation
- Safe cursor and rendering logic (handles terminal resizing and wide characters)
