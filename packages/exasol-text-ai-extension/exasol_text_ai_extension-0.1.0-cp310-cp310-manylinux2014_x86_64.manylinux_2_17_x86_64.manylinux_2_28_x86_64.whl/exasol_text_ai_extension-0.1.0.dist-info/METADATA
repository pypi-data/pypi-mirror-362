# Exasol Text AI

Exasol Text AI is a native Exasol solution that leverages AI to transform unstructured and semi-structured business data into relational data that can power analytics and drive insight. Exasol Text AI is as a paid extension of Exasol that requires an Exasol database (and license) and will be deployed via [AI Lab](https://github.com/exasol/ai-lab/).

This package uses UDFs that process the target unstructured data and then uses third-party language models to extract insights. The output data is then stored in a relational model within the Exasol database to power analytics and AI-aided insights. The language models are open source and downloaded from Huggingface.

For a commercial evaluation, Text AI comes with a free community license that is limited in features and in the raw data size it will process.
