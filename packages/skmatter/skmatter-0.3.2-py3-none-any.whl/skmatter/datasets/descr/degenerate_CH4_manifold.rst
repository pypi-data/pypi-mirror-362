.. _degenerate_manifold:

Degenerate CH4 manifold
#######################

The dataset contains two representations (SOAP power spectrum and bispectrum) of the two
manifolds spanned by the carbon atoms of two times 81 methane structures. The SOAP power
spectrum representation the two manifolds intersect creating a degenerate manifold/line
for which the representation remains the same. In contrast for higher body order
representations as the (SOAP) bispectrum the carbon atoms can be uniquely represented
and do not create a degenerate manifold. Following the naming convention of
[Pozdnyakov2020]_ for each representation the first 81 samples correspond to the X minus
manifold and the second 81 samples contain the X plus manifold

Data Set Characteristics
------------------------

:Number of Instances: Each representation 162

:Number of Features: Each  representation 12

The representations were computed with [D1]_ using the hyperparameters:

The SOAP bispectrum features were in addition reduced to 12 features with principal
component analysis (PCA) [D2]_.
