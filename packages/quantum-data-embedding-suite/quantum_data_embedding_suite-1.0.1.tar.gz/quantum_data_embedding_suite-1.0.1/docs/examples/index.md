## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

```python
# Basic classification pipeline
from quantum_data_embedding_suite import QuantumEmbeddingPipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC

pipeline = QuantumEmbeddingPipeline(embedding_type="angle", n_qubits=4)
K_train = pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)
K_test = pipeline.transform(X_test)

svm = SVC(kernel='precomputed')
svm.fit(K_train, y_train)
predictions = svm.predict(K_test)
```

```python
# Embedding quality assessment
metrics = pipeline.evaluate_embedding(X)
print(f"Expressibility: {metrics['expressibility']:.3f}")
print(f"Trainability: {metrics['trainability']:.3f}")
```

```python
# Multi-embedding comparison
embeddings = ["angle", "amplitude", "iqp"]
for emb_type in embeddings:
    pipeline = QuantumEmbeddingPipeline(embedding_type=emb_type, n_qubits=4)
    accuracy = evaluate_classification(pipeline, X, y)
    print(f"{emb_type}: {accuracy:.3f}")
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 3-4 qubits and simple embeddings
2. **Normalize Data**: Always preprocess data with StandardScaler
3. **Choose Appropriate Shots**: 1024-2048 shots balance accuracy and speed
4. **Cache Results**: Enable caching for repeated computations
5. **Batch Processing**: Use batches for large datasets (>1000 samples)

### Common Pitfalls

- **Insufficient Qubits**: Too few qubits limit expressibility
- **Poor Normalization**: Unnormalized data leads to poor embeddings
- **Overfitting**: High-dimensional quantum spaces can overfit easily
- **Noise Sensitivity**: Real quantum devices introduce additional noise
- **Computational Cost**: Quantum simulations scale exponentially

## Dataset Examples

### Small Datasets (< 1000 samples)

- Iris (150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes)
- Wine (178 samples, 13 features, 3 classes)
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (569 samples, 30 features, 2 classes)

### Medium Datasets (1000-10000 samples)

- MNIST subset (5000 samples, 784 features, 10 classes)
- Digits (1797 samples, 64 features, 10 classes)
- Olivetti Faces (400 samples, 4096 features, 40 classes)

### Large Datasets (> 10000 samples)
