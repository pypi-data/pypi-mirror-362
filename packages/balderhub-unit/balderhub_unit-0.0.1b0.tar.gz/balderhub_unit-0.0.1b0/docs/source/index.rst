BalderHub-Unit
==============

The BalderHub Unit package provides basic Balder objects to create device indipendent tests.

This is a BalderHub package for the `Balder <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_ test framework. It allows a simple start with
Balder while staying able to expand your tests and fully use the feature set of that framework. If you are new to
Balder check out the `official documentation <https://docs.balder.dev>`_ first.
