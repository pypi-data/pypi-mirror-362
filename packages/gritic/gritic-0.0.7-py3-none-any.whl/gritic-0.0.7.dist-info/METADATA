Dynamic: summary

A tool for timing complex copy number gains in cancer. Provides gain timing estimates for segments with a total copy number of up to 9. Only copy number segments with 10 or more SNVs will be timed.

Each gain timing is measured in mutation time, a scale that ranges from 0 to 1. A timing of 0 indicates that the gain occured close to conception and 1 that the gain occurred very close to the emergence of the tumour's most recent common ancestor.
