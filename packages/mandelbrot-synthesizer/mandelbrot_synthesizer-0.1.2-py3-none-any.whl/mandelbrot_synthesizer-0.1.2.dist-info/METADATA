## Description

This project generates sounds from multiple fractals, including: mandelbrot, burning ship and more. You can generate a tone by clicking any point on the fractal and it will generate a custom frequency and volume based on the number of iterations of the point. You can choose to save the sound by pressing enter, and the sound will be saved to the library folder located inside this project.

## Installation

install using pip install mandelbrot-synthesizer then type mandelbrot_synthesizer in the terminal

## controls

Just use the enter key to save the sound (sounds are named after the point that you clicked to make them)
