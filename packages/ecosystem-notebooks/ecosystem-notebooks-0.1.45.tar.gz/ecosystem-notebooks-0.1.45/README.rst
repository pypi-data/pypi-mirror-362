Ecosystem Notebooks
===================

What is Ecosystem Notebooks?
----------------------------

Ecosystem Notebooks is a wrapper for the Ecosystem API servers. They can
be used for both the Prediction and Runtime servers.

The notebooks are a great interface to work from in order to test, and
explore the serverâ€™s capabilities. They allow you to navigate them
easily by removing the complexities of directly interacting with the
APIs.

Ecosystem Notebooks are built using the Jupyter Notebook coding
environment, and Python 3 kernel for code execution.

Requirements
------------

-  To use any of the notebooks, access to an Ecosystem API server is
   required
-  `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__
-  `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__: The notebooks were
   built using python 3.6, but most Python 3 versions will work

Getting started
---------------

To begin using Ecosystem Notebooks, you need to first install Jupyter
Notebook.

This can be done by running the configure_jupyter.sh shell script. In
addition, recommended styling options can be added by running the
configure_jupyter_styling.sh shell script. While this is not required,
you are welcome to play around with it to personalise the Ecosystem
workbench style.

To install the relevant python code, add the parent directory
(ecosystem-notebooks) to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Once Jupyter is installed, enter the directory containing the notebooks.
At the designated .ipynb extension, run the command:

.. code:: bash

   jupyter notebook

This will open up a default web browser to the Jupyter Notebook landing
page from which you can open up one of the desired notebooks.

How does Ecosystem Notebooks work
---------------------------------

From within a chosen notebook, Ecosystem Notebooks can be used. This
coding environment, from which you can edit and run live code, provides
the interface with which to utilise the API endpoints for Ecosystem
Prediction and Runtime servers.For easy navigation within any of the
notebooks, you can use the table of contents which will be situated on
the left.

In order for the API endpoints to properly function, you will need to
login. Depending on which notebooks you have chosen to use, logging in
could require a URL endpoint. Or a username, password and URL
combination, which will generate an authentication token. This token
will activate the API, then you can begin using Ecosystem Notebooks!

Ecosystem Notebooks contains all the available API endpoints on the
Ecosystem Servers. You can either play around in the ecosystem
environment, or you can use it in your own chosen infrastructure.
