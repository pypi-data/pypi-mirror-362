Add method to get source location of Inventory Routes
-----------------------------------------------------

This technical module extends the ``stock.route`` model to add the
method ``_get_source_location(dest_location)``. It recursively traces
upstream rules (``pull`` or ``pull_push``) from a destination location,
and returns the ultimate source location — stopping at a rule with
``procure_method='make_to_stock'`` or when no applicable pull rules
remain.

Useful for multi-hop route setups (e.g., warehouse → packing → output),
to programmatically determine the actual stock source. No UI changes are
made — it's purely for custom logic or other technical modules.

**Example usage:**

.. code:: python

   route = env.ref("stock.route_warehouse0_mto")
   dest = env.ref("stock.stock_location_customers")
   src = route._get_source_location(dest)
   print(src.display_name)
