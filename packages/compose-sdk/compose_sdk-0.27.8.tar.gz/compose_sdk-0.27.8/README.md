## What is Compose

Compose is a dramatically faster way for developers to build custom internal tools.

Compose provides:
- Backend SDKs for TypeScript and Python that provide high-level building blocks like tables, forms, charts, and more that integrate seamlessly with your existing services and logic.
- A hosted web app (composehq.com or self-hosted) that handles auth, permissions, audit logs, and generates exceptionally great UIs for your team.

The examples below show how you can build a dashboard to view and create users in ~20 lines of code.

See the [docs](https://docs.composehq.com) to learn more.
