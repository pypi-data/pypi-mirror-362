This fork attempts to provide a Python3.12-compatible version of SIMA.
Not all features are tested and only the motion detection is the focus of this fork.

The fixes applied here are thanks to `this <https://github.com/neurodroid/sima/tree/py3>`_ other fork, and personal trial-and-error.

Overview
--------

SIMA (Sequential IMage Analysis) is an Open Source package for 
analysis of time-series imaging data arising from fluorescence
microscopy.  The functionality of this package includes:

- correction of motion artifacts
- segmentation of imaging fields into regions of interest (ROIs)
- extraction of dynamic signals from ROIs

The included ROI Buddy software provides a graphical user interface
(GUI) supporting the following functionality:

- manual creation of ROIs
- editing of ROIs resulting from automated segmentation
- registration of ROIs across separate imaging sessions


Installation and Use
--------------------
For complete documentation go to <http://www.losonczylab.org/sima>


Dependencies
-------------

* `Python <http://python.org>`_ 2.7 
* `numpy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ >= 1.6.2
* `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ >= 0.13.0
* `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org>`_ >= 0.9.3 (0.11.0 recommended)
* `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ >= 0.11
* `shapely <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_ >= 1.2.14 (**Windows users**: be sure to install from `Christophe Gohlke's built wheels <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely>`_)
* `pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_ >= 2.6.1
* `future <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`_ >= 0.14

Optional dependencies
---------------------

* `OpenCV <http://opencv.org>`_ >= 2.4.8, required for segmentation,
  registration of ROIs across multiple datasets, and the ROI Buddy GUI
* `picos <http://picos.zib.de>`_ >= 1.0.2, required for spike inference (>= 1.1 required for Python 3)
* `pyfftw <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFFTW>`_, allows faster performance of some motion correction methods when installed together with FFTW.
* `h5py <http://www.h5py.org>`_ >= 2.2.1 (2.3.1 recommended), required for HDF5 file format 
* `bottleneck <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Bottleneck>`_ >=0.8, for faster calculations
* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_ >= 1.2.1, for saving extraction summary plots
* `mdp <http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net>`_, required for ICA demixing of
  channels

If you build the package from source, you may also need:

* `Cython <http://cython.org>`_

If you are using the spike inference feature, we strongly recommend installing
`MOSEK <https://www.mosek.com/>`_ (free for academic use) which greatly speeds
up the inference.
