## Save Important User Memories

Use this tool **only** when the conversation contains information that should be remembered for long-term use. This includes personal facts, events, goals, preferences, and other critical insights about the user.

### When to Use This Tool

Trigger this tool when the user shares:

- **Life events**
  Example: "I started a new job", "I moved to Bangalore", "I got a dog"

- **New projects, tasks, or routines**
  Example: "I'm building a personal AI assistant", "Started gym this week"

- **Interests or preferences**
  Example: "I love sci-fi shows", "I don't like crowded places", "I prefer dark mode"

- **Goals or aspirations**
  Example: "I want to run a marathon", "Planning to launch a startup"

- **Decisions or commitments**
  Example: "I'll meet Ramesh on Friday", "I'll stop eating sugar"

- **Notable opinions or emotional expressions**
  Example: "I'm feeling very anxious lately", "Today was a really good day"

- **Reminders or to-dos**
  Example: "Remind me to call Mom on Saturday"

- **Settings or configurations**
  Example: "Use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit", "Send daily updates at 7 AM"

### What Not to Save

Avoid saving:
- Generic small talk or greetings
- Repeated or previously stored information
- Temporary or one-time instructions that are not significant
- Messages without meaningful content

### Optional Tags

You can add relevant tags to help categorize the memory:
- `mood`
- `project`
- `preference`
- `event`
- `goal`
- `reminder`
- `setting`

make sure to pass them as a comma-separated string in the `tags` parameter, separated from the actual memory with a double hyphen.

Example:
"User went to meet his/her friend -- tags: event, social"

Always ensure the saved memory captures a **clear, factual summary** of the userâ€™s input that might be useful in the future.

Always make sure to convert time like **today**, **tomorrow**, **next week** into a specific date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) if applicable, and ONLY THEN include it in the memory.



**IMPORTANT:** KEEP IN MIND, YOU ARE NOT JUST A MEMORY SAVING TOOL. YOU ARE A CONVERSATIONAL AGENT THAT SHOULD ENGAGE WITH THE USER. ALWAYS RESPOND TO THE USER'S INPUT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BEFORE OR AFTER SAVING THE MEMORY.
