terms:
  Costs and Payments: |
    The legal services are free to client. LAWV may ask client to pay for unavoidable costs such as filing fees, 
    witness fees, discovery costs, or other litigation costs. If client is unable to pay, LAWV may pay costs. 
    If client receives a financial settlement, client shall reimburse LAWV actual costs. LAWV will not take 
    action to collect costs if it causes client undue hardship.
  Attorney fees: |
    In some cases, LAWV may receive reimbursement for attorney fees or other costs to be paid by defendants, 
    government programs, insurance groups or third parties. These fees will not reduce settlement funds due to 
    client. LAWV clients will never be asked to pay attorney fees to LAWV.
  Payment Source and potential conflicts: |
    Various government grants and private donations fund LAWV. These third-party funds may come with restrictions 
    that impact a case or the services LAWV can provide. If the grant funder has a restriction as it relates to 
    the case, LAWV will provide information about the conflict, may assign a different advocate to the matter, and/or 
    may be unable to provide services. Information about the grant or third party providing for the advocacy in 
    each case is available on request.
  Settlement Decisions: |
    LAWV will not settle a case without client agreement, but LAWV may resolve the matter within client's specific, 
    authorized settlement terms.
  Cooperation: |
    Client will provide accurate information about the case, report any changes in circumstances such as address, 
    phone number, income, or household size, and assist the advocate as requested.
  Ending Services by Client or LAWV: |
    Client can tell LAWV to stop providing services at any time. LAWV may end services after informing Client 
    of the reasons for ending services.
  Statement of Client Rights: |
    LAWV will provide a “Statement of Client Rights” upon request.
  Confidentiality: |
    All client information is confidential. LAWV will not share information without client's permission, except as 
    permitted or required by law or the Rules of Professional Conduct. LAWV may share information with attorneys 
    in their Pro Bono Program.
  Data Retention: |
    LAWV will retain electronic communications (email) for two (2) years following the time of the communication. 
    LAWV may destroy any client records (including paper copies) after ten (10) years. Client may request a copy 
    of the LAWV file before destruction.
  Sharing of non-identifying data: |
    LAWV may share data that contains no identifying information for various reports. This may include services 
    provided, general case outcomes, demographics, or other information reflective overall of LAWV's services.
  Use of Technology: |
    LAWV may use technology, including artificial intelligence, for various tasks. All client specific information 
    will remain confidential.
  Copy of Agreement: |
    LAWV will provide a copy of this agreement once it is signed.
  Understanding this agreement: |
    By signing below, client acknowledges that LAWV has reviewed this agreement, client understands the agreement 
    and signs this document freely and voluntarily.
  Use of Information: |
    To allow LAWV to determine outcome of services provided and assist in determining the impacts of services, 
    Client authorizes LAWV to use personal information to gather data from public sources (such as DMV, SSA, etc.) 
    for up to one year after services end.
  Co-representation: |
    I understand that LAWV can assist multiple clients when interests are similar. Clients acknowledge that LAWV 
    will not withhold any information between clients. LAWV will move to withdraw from all parties if the parties' 
    interests are no longer the same, as it relates to strategy, relief, settlement, or other issues. I understand 
    that this may impact future services that LAWV can provide.
  Parties to the Retainer: |
    I understand that this agreement is between my and my advocate.
  Advocate is not an attorney: |
    I understand that my advocate is **NOT** an **ATTORNEY**.
  Transfer to an attorney: |
    I understand that I can request my case be referred to an attorney if issues arise that would meet the level 
    of need for an attorney.
  Limitation of transferring to an attorney: |
    I understand that if my case is referred to an attorney that I will only be provided an attorney if I meet 
    program guidelines, and if the attorney agrees to take my case after I have a consultation with the attorney.
  Free Services and costs: |
    I understand that assistance will be provided to me for free by Legal Aid of West Virginia. If there are costs 
    that cannot be waived, Legal Aid may ask me to pay them if I am able. If I am not able, Legal Aid might be able 
    to pay these costs.
  Confidentiality and disclosure: |
    I understand that my information is confidential. Legal Aid of West Virginia will not disclose my confidential 
    information without my permission, except as permitted or required by the legal ethical rules of West Virginia.
  Changes to information: |
    I understand it is my responsibility to keep Legal Aid and my advocate aware of any changes in my contact information.
  Right to discontinue: |
    I understand that I may discontinue services at any time. Discontinuing services does not affect my ability to 
    request services in the future.
  Right to a complaint: |
    I understand that I have a right to file a complaint about the services I am receiving.
  Legal Aid's right to discontinue: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia may discontinue advocacy services or stop representing me before the completion of my 
    case, but only when there is a good reason for doing that. Good reason includes but is not limited to; if I do not 
    provide complete or truthful information about my case, don't stay in touch with Legal Aid or if I do not report 
    changes in my phone number, address or income, Legal Aid may have to stop helping me. Legal Aid will only stop 
    representing me after telling me the reason and giving me a chance to explain why advocacy services should not be 
    ended.
  Child or dependent as FAST client: |
    I have been counseled that my child/dependent is the client of FAST and as their parent/guardian I am authorized to 
    make decisions on their behalf. However, if there comes a point in the process where the advocate determines that 
    the decisions I am making are not in their client's best interest, the advocate may discontinue advocacy services, 
    but only after discussing the issue with me.
  Child or dependent as BHA client: |
    I have been counseled that my dependent/principal is the client of the Behavioral Health Advocacy program and as 
    their guardian/legal representative I am authorized to make decisions for them or on their behalf. However, if there 
    comes a point in the process where the advocate determines that the decisions I am making are not in their client's 
    best interest, the advocate may discontinue advocacy services, but only after discussing the issue with me.
  Provide documentation: |
    I understand that I must provide Legal Aid of West Virginia with a copy of legal documentation that gives me decision 
    making authority. I also understand that should that authority be removed, I am required to inform the advocate immediately.
