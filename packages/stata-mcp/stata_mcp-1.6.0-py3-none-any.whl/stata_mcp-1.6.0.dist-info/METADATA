- Claude, Cline, ChatWise, or other LLM service
- Stata License
- Your API-KEY from LLM

### Installation
For the new version, you don't need to install the `stata-mcp` package again, you can just use the following command to check whether your computer can use stata-mcp.
```bash
uvx stata-mcp --usable
uvx stata-mcp --version
```

If you want to use it locally, you can install it via pip or download the source code.

**Download via pip**
```bash
pip install stata-mcp
```

**Download source code and compile**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp.git
cd stata-mcp

uv build
```
Then you can find the compiled `stata-mcp` binary in the `dist` directory. You can use it directly or add it to your PATH.

For example:
```bash
uvx /path/to/your/whl/stata_mcp-1.6.0-py3-non-any.whl  # here is the wheel file name, you can change it to your version
```
