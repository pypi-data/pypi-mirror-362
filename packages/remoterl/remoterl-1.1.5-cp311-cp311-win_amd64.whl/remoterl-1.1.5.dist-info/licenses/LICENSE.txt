## 4. FEES; DATA CREDIT

4.1 **Data Credit Purchase & Free Allowance.** Customer must maintain a positive Data Credit balance as described on Licensor's website or order form. Customer may receive a one-time or recurring free allowance (expressed in gigabytes) if and as stated on the website. **Any such free allowance is provided "AS IS" without warranty or support, and Licensor assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or claim arising from Customer's use of the free Data Credit.** All devices that present the same API-key draw from a single, shared Data Credit wallet.

4.2 **Pre-paid Deposit Metering.** Data relay traffic is debited from the Data Credit balance under the **1 MB deposit window** with a **10 KiB minimum charge per transaction**, as described in **Exhibit B**.

4.3 **Suspension & Remote Disable.** In addition to other remedies, Licensor may remotely deactivate the SDK or block access if: **(a)** any undisputed fees remain overdue by more than fourteen (14) days; **(b)** Customer breaches Section 3 (Restrictions) or Section 7 (Intellectual Property); or **(c)** Licensor reasonably suspects fraud, abuse, or security threats. Except in an emergency affecting security or legal compliance, Licensor will give at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice before deactivation.

4.4 **Credit Expiry.** Data Credit that remains unused twelve (12) months after purchase expires and is forfeited without refund, unless otherwise required by law.

## 5. TERM & TERMINATION

5.1 **Term.** This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until terminated in accordance with this Section 5.

5.2 **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure within ten (10) days after receipt of notice.

5.3 **Effect of Termination.** Upon any termination, Customer must cease all use of the SDK, delete all copies, and destroy any Confidential Information. **Automated backup copies that cannot be individually erased will be overwritten according to regular rotation cycles and are inaccessible in production; they will be purged automatically upon expiry.** Sections 3, 4.3, 5.3, 6 - 11 survive termination.

## 6. FEEDBACK

Customer hereby grants Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, modify, and otherwise exploit any suggestions, comments, or other feedback provided by Customer relating to the SDK or the Remote Reinforcement Learning Service.

## 7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The SDK and Remote Reinforcement Learning Service, including all copies, improvements, and derivatives, are and remain the sole property of Licensor and its licensors. Customer acquires no ownership interest. All trademarks, service marks, and logos are the exclusive property of Licensor and may not be used without Licensor's prior written consent.

## 8. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

8.1 **No Storage of Relay Payloads.** Observations, actions, rewards, and similar runtime data transmitted through the Remote Reinforcement Learning Service are processed only in volatile memory and are **not** persisted by Licensor.

8.2 **Ephemeral Configuration Data.** Session parameters such as `num_workers` and `num_env_runners` are retained solely for operational control and are automatically deleted within seven (7) days of session close.

8.3 **Event Logs.** Licensor may collect anonymised or aggregated diagnostic events emitted by the SDK (e.g., crash reports, error codes) to improve reliability and detect abuse.

8.4 **Usage Metrics.** Licensor records network byte counts, duration, and similar metadata for billing and analytics. Licensor will not inspect Customer-generated payloads unless strictly necessary to investigate service incidents, and will notify Customer prior to such inspection whenever legally permissible.

8.5 **Security Measures.** Licensor implements industry-standard technical and organisational measures to protect data against unauthorised access, as further described in **Exhibit C**.

8.6 **Data Processing Addendum.** The parties incorporate the Data Processing Addendum in **Exhibit C (DPA)**, which prevails over this Agreement in the event of any conflict concerning personal data.

## EXHIBIT A - THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS

None. The SDK bundles no third-party software that requires separate attribution.

---

## EXHIBIT B - DATA CREDIT METERING RULES

* **Unit:** bytes transmitted by the client.
* **Unit Changes:** Licensor may revise the accounting unit (e.g., KB, MB, or GB) or the deposit window in a commercially reasonable manner, with at least thirty (30) days' prior notice via the customer portal or email.
* **Per-message minimum:** 10 KiB.
* **Deposit window:** When the in-memory deposit pool is insufficient, **1 MB** is debited from the wallet.
* **Ledger update:** Each successful deposit increments `usedDataMB` by 1 MB.
* **Idle overhead:** While a session is idle (training setup or simulators waiting), a 1 MB deposit is charged approximately every 5~10 minutes per connection to cover keepalive traffic and reserved resources.
* **Failure:** If the wallet balance falls below **1 MB**, the SDK raises an **alarm (`credit_exhausted`)**. Users are alerted to their remaining data balance every 5-10 minutes and can monitor live usage on the RemoteRL billing dashboard.
