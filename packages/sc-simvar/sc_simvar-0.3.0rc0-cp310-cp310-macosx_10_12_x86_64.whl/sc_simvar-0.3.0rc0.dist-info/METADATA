# sc_simvar

A re-implementation of the [hotspotsc](https://github.com/YosefLab/Hotspot) v1.1.1 Python package using Rust for the computationally intensive portions.

Not all code from `hotspotsc` has been translated to Rust, but all code has been localized.

All functions (Rust and Python) are tested to have the exact same output as Hotspotsc for the same input data. 

## Performance

Using simulated data that varied in the number of genes, cells, and dimensions I ran the pipeline varying whether approx_neighbors or the weighted_graph were used when calculating the knn graph. For the local correlations I used half the number of genes to calculate the correlations on.

Across the 108 total simulations performed the mean speed up of `SCSimVar` over `Hotspot` was: **3x**.

## Installation

=== "pip"

    ```
    pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.cedar.roche.com sc_simvar
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```
    uv tool install --extra-index-url https://pypi.cedar.roche.com sc_simvar
    ```

## Usage

The ``SCSimVar`` class of this package is a direct replacement for the ``Hotspot`` class of ``hotspotsc``.

```python
from sc_simvar import SCSimVar as Hotspot

# Your old code here, no changes needed.
```

If you run into a problem with ``SCSimVar`` compared to ``Hotspot`` please let me know!
