This module allows importing vendor price lists from Excel files,
matching products using any product template char field.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Vendor pricelists sheet files could come in a variety of column formats.
We can configure templates to match them to know what data we need to
store in our pricelist.

To do so:

1.  Go to *Purchase > Configuration > Vendor pricelist import
    templates*.
2.  Edit or create a new one.
3.  Create a template name.
4.  Assign a default supplier. (Set a default supplier that will be
    associated with this template)
5.  In the **Header Offset**, determine the line where the headers are
    located. (Specify the line number where the column headers are found
    in your sheet file)
6.  In the **Sheet Number**, we will be able to specify the page number
    to select it.
7.  In the **Search Header Name**, set the name of the column you want
    to filter by. (Indicate the column name used for filtering the data)
8.  In the Search Field, set the data you want to filter by. (Specify
    the field used for filtering)
9.  Set a headers mapping with the rest header names and which fields we
    should update. (Map the remaining header names to the corresponding
    fields that should be updated in the system)
10. A header mapping could have no related field, but is important to
    have it if we want to detect the sheet data when we are importing.
11. The order isn't important. (The order of the header mappings does
    not affect the import process)
12. If **Only Update Existing** is checked, only existing pricelists
    will be updated; no new ones will be created.
13. If **Show Not Updated Rates** is enabled, the unupdated rates will
    be shown grouped at the end of the import.
14. If a column in the sheet is empty, set a field with a space (" ")
    inside to ensure a match.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Purchase > Configuration > Import vendor pricelists*.
2. Upload your vendor pricelists sheet file.
3. Set the vendor partner, the date from which the pricelists are valid
   and the lead days.
4. Click on import and view.

If a template for that file is configured, it will match the headers
with the column values and create or update the vendor pricelists
accordingly.
