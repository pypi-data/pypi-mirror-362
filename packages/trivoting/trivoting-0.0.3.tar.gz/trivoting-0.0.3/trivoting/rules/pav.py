    multiplicity : int
        The number of identical ballots represented by this voter.

    """
    Compute the selections of the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule via Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
    The ILP is solved with the `pulp` package.

    The definition of the PAV rule for the trichotomous context is taken from Section 3.3 of
    ``Proportionality in Thumbs Up and Down Voting`` (Kraiczy, Papasotiropoulos, Pierczy≈Ñski and Skowron, 2025).

    Parameters
    ----------
    profile : AbstractTrichotomousProfile
        The trichotomous profile.
    max_size_selection : int
        Maximum number of alternatives to select.
    initial_selection : Selection, optional
        An initial partial selection fixing some alternatives as selected or rejected.
        If `implicit_reject` is True in the initial selection, no alternatives are fixed to be rejected.
        Defaults to None.
    resoluteness : bool, optional
        If True, returns a single optimal selection (resolute).
        If False, returns all tied optimal selections (irresolute).
        Defaults to True.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, enables ILP solver output.
        Defaults to False.
    max_seconds : int, optional
        Time limit in seconds for the ILP solver.
        Defaults to 600.

    Returns
    -------
    Selection | list[Selection]
        The selection if resolute (:code:`resoluteness == True`), or a list of selections
        if irresolute (:code:`resoluteness == False`).
