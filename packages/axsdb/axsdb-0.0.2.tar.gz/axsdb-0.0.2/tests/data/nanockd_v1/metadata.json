Conventionally synthetic spectra are calculated by computing a lineshape for every spectral line in the database and adding those together, which may take multiple hours for large databases. In this paper we propose a new approach for spectral synthesis based on an integral transform: the synthetic spectrum is calculated as the integral over the product of a Voigt profile and a newly proposed three-dimensional \u201clineshape distribution function\u201d, which is a function of spectral position and Gaussian- & Lorentzian width coordinates. A fast discrete version of this transform based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed, which improves performance compared to the conventional approach by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy. Strategies that minimize the discretization error are discussed. A Python implementation of the method is compared against state-of-the-art spectral code RADIS, and is since adopted as RADIS's default synthesis method. The synthesis of a benchmark CO2 spectrum consisting of 1.8\u00a0M spectral lines and 200k spectral points took only 3.1\u00a0s using the proposed method (1011 lines\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0spectral points/s), a factor \u223c300 improvement over the state-of-the-art, with the relative improvement generally increasing for higher number of lines and/or number of spectral points. An experimental GPU-implementation of the method was also benchmarked, which demonstrated another 2~3 orders performance increase, achieving up to 5 \u22c5 1014 lines\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0spectral points/s.","container-title":"Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer","DOI":"10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107476","ISSN":"0022-4073","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer","language":"en","page":"107476","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A discrete integral transform for rapid spectral synthesis","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407320310049","volume":"261","author":[{"family":"Bekerom","given":"D.

RADIS is built around the HITRAN, HITEMP and CDSD databases for molecules in their electronic ground state. Energy levels are read from tabulated databases or calculated from Dunham expansions. Boltzmann, Treanor, and arbitrary vibrational distributions can be generated. In its present version, nonequilibrium spectra can be computed for CO2 and CO, and equilibrium spectra can be computed for all species of the HITRAN database. New species can be added without modification to the core code. Several optimization strategies are described that reduce computation times of high-temperature, high-resolution spectra with millions of lines down to less than a minute. Additionally, RADIS includes a line survey tool, a built-in look-up database to reduce convergence times when fitting experimental spectra, and a multi-slab module to simulate line-of-sight experiments. Validation cases against existing spectral codes and experimental results from various plasma sources are presented. Finally, RADIS is applied to improve the modeling of the radiation from a plasma torch and a nonequilibrium expansion-tube experiment.
