# FastLED WASM Server

FastLED WASM Server + Compiler

This will only work in the `niteris/fastled-wasm` container.

## Installation

You can install this package in two modes:

### Minimal Installation (Client Only)
For applications that only need to use the HTTP clients to communicate with a FastLED WASM server:

```bash
pip install fastled-wasm-server
```

This installs only the essential dependencies (`httpx`, `pydantic`) needed for:
- `ClientAsync` and `ClientSync` classes
- Model classes for API responses
- Type definitions

### Full Installation (Server + Client)
For running the full FastLED WASM server with all functionality:

```bash
pip install fastled-wasm-server[full]
```

This installs all dependencies including FastAPI, Uvicorn, and the WASM compiler for:
- Complete server functionality
- CLI tools (`fastled-wasm-server`, `fastled-wasm-mcp-server`)
- All client functionality
- Development server capabilities

# Develop

At the root execute `./install`


#### Lint

`./lint`

#### Test

`./test`

# Windows

This environment requires you to use `git-bash`.
