# P2V - designing chips in Python
Python to Verilog compiler

# What is P2V?
P2V is a python library used to generate synthesizable RTL. The RTL modules written in Python are converted to Verilog.

# Who is P2V meant for?
P2V is meant for chip designers familiar with Verilog and Python.


# Installation
**pip install p2v-compiler**

P2V is a native Python3 library, it needs no special installations for its basic function.
Beyond basic functionality P2V does take advantage of the following open-source tools, and their absence will shut off their corresponding features:
1.	Verible – used for Verilog indentation
https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible
2.	Slang – used for Verilog module instantiations
https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang
3.	Verilator – Verilog linter
https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html
4.	Iverilog – Verilog simulator

# Using partially installed P2V	
P2V can run without all its dependencies, but in order to do that the -allow_missing_tools should be added to the command line, that will allow, for example, running without indenting files if the indentation tool is not installed.
