Changelog
=========

0.0.3 (2025-07-15)
------------------

- requiring seppl>=0.2.20 now for improved help requests in `sdc-convert` tool


0.0.2 (2025-07-11)
------------------

- wai.spectralio-based readers now instantiate the wai.spectralio reader in the `initialize` method
- wai.spectralio-based writers now instantiate the wai.spectralio writer in the `initialize` method
- introduced `SpectralIOBased`, `SpectralIOReader` and `SpectralIOWriter` mixins to wai.spectralio-based
  readers/writers for a cleaner class hierarchy
- requiring wai-spectralio>=0.0.5 now
- requiring seppl>=0.2.19 now
- added experimental support for direct read/write operations using file-like objects
- fixed initialization of sample ID and sample data prefix in `CSVSampleDataWriter`
- fixed initialization of None values of `OPUSExtReader`, aligning it with the command-line args
- added `from-zip` meta-reader for reading spectra and sample data from zip files
- added `to-zip` meta-writer for writing spectra and sample data to zip files
