# RamanBiolib

A Raman spectral search library for biological molecules identification, over a database of 140 components, including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, amino acids, metabolites, nucleic acids, pigments and others.

The library supports identification via spectral similarity or peak-matching algorithms, using either full spectrum plots or most relevant peak positions. For details on the underlying methods, see our [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5185686).

## Installation

```
pip install ramanbiolib
```

## RamanBiolib Graphical User Interface (GUI)

For the GUI see the project [RamanBiolib-UI](https://github.com/mteranm/ramanbiolib-ui)

## Usage

### Spectra similarity search
Identify an unkown component by its Raman spectrum.

```
spectra_search = SpectraSimilaritySearch(wavenumbers=wavenumbers)
search_results = spectra_search.search(
    unknown_spectrum,
    class_filter=None,
    unique_components_in_results=True,
    similarity_method="slk",
    similarity_params=25 # Window size
)
```

Show the top N results

```
search_results.get_results(limit=10)
```

Visualy compare the results

```
search_results.plot_results(n=2)
```

### Peak matching search

Identify an unkown component by its Raman spectrum most relevant peaks positions.

```
pm_search = PeakMatchingSearch(wavenumbers=wavenumbers)
pm_search_results = pm_search.search(
        peaks_wavenumbers,
        tolerance=5,
        class_filter=None,
        sort_score='IUR',
        min_peak_intensity=0,
        tol_penalty="linear",
        unique_components_in_results=True
    )
```

Show the top N results

```
pm_search_results.get_results(limit=10, sort_col='IUR')
```

## How to contribute with Raman spectra

> **Note:** All contributed spectral data will be licensed under ODbL open database license. See the [license section](#license) for details.

The collaborative effort of the research community is essential to expanding this open spectral library for biomolecule identification. We welcome your contributions through the following methods:

### Measured spectra (✅ Preferred Option)

Spectra measured in the laboratory can be included if they are from an isolated pure sample of a biomolecule.

### Articles plots digitazion

As done in the initial version of this database, you can contribute to the digitazion process of the already published Raman spectra in articles figures.  
- [Plot figure trace extraction example notebook](https://github.com/mteranm/ramanbiolib/blob/main/examples/extraction/extraction-example.ipynb)  

> **Important:** Only spectra digitized from figures in published articles are accepted.

### Contribution process

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Add your new spectra entries to:
   - `raman_spectra_db.csv`
   - `raman_peaks_db.csv`
   - `metadata_db.csv`
3. **Commit** your changes.
4. Open a **Pull Request (PR)**.
5. Once reviewed and approved, your contribution will be included in the next database release.

To contribute, you need to add new rows with the new spectra information in all database files: raman_spectra_db.csv, raman_peaks_db.csv, and metadata_db.csv.

> **Mandatory Fields:** (M) are mandatory fields, (R) are optional but recommended.

#### Spectra plot (raman_spectra_db.csv)

- **id (M)**: the identifier of the spectrum in this database. This is a incremental id, therefore new specturm will be identified with max_current_id + 1. (This id needs to match with the other files id for the same spectrum measurement)
- **component (M)**: component name (in lower case, if the component is already existing in the database use the same name)
- **wavenumbers (M)**: a list of the spectrum wavenumbers, minimum from 450 to 1800 with a step of 1cm⁻¹ (e.g., "[450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, ... , 1800]")
- **intensity (M)**: a list of the spectrum intensity values (e.g., "[0.021540, 0.0215406, ..., 0.0137668])

The spectra needs to be standarized as follows:

> **Standarization:** 
> - Smoothed to reduce noise
> - Baseline removed
> - Interpolated to minimum 450-1800 cm⁻¹ with a step of 1 cm⁻¹
> - Min-max normalized
> 

#### Peak positions list (raman_peaks_db.csv)

- **id (M)**: the identifier of the spectrum in this database. This is a incremental id, therefore new specturm will be identified with max_current_id + 1. (This id need to match with the other files id for the same spectrum measurement)
- **component (M)**: component name (in lower case, if the component is already existing in the database use the same name)
- **peaks (M)**: the position (in wavenumbers cm⁻¹) of the most relevant peaks, integer values (e.g., "[536, 560, 623, ..., 1612]"). All relevant peaks within the range 450 to 1800 cm⁻¹ need to be added.
- **intensity (M)**: the list of the intensity of the most relevan peaks, after min-max normalization, the list size and order need to match the previous column size. (e.g., "[0.021540, 0.021540, ..., 0.013766])
