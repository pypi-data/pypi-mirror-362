# colleKtions
A collection of Python functions on iterables and collections inspired by the 
[Kotlin collections standard library API](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/#functions).

For the curious, the name is a reference to the Kotlin collections API in two ways: 
1. The name collections, which is obvious
2. The intentional misspelling with a K since `kt` is the file extension used for Kotlin source 
   files.
