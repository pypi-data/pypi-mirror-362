class TypeSig:
  """
  #  DESCRIPTION
  'TypeSig' describes the types of an array of positional arguments
  analogous to how the 'type' function describes the 'type' of a single
  argument. The class supports both explicit types and the 'THIS'
  placeholder sentinel.

  #  NOMENCLATURE

  - 'Call arguments':  A tuple of objects. For example, the arguments
  received by a callable object.
  - 'type parsing':  The process by which the 'TypeSig' object determines
  how it best matches call arguments. If possible, the 'TypeSig' object
  will return a tuple of objects matching it. If not possible, a custom
  exception is raised. More details provided below.
  - 'type parser':  The 'TypeSig' instance method performing the 'type
  parsing'. The method receives 'call arguments' and returns 'processed
  arguments' (described below) or raises a custom exception specific to
  itself.
  - 'Processed arguments':  A tuple of objects returned by the 'TypeSig'
  object after parsing.
  - 'type casting':  same as 'type parsing' but emphasizes changes applied
  changing call arguments to processed arguments.

  #  USAGE
  #  #  Type Guarding and Casting
  A function requiring a very specific type signature, might use an
  instance of 'TypeSig' to type parse and possibly cast received arguments
  to match the required types. This allows the function more flexibility
  in what arguments it accepts while retaining the initial type
  specificity. Additionally, unsupported types are caught immediately and
  explicitly allowing for explicit and precise error handling.

  #  #  Hashable
  Since 'TypeSig' objects are hashable(*) they may be used as keys in
  'dict' objects. This facilitates dispatching of function calls to a type
  appropriate overload.

  #  IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
  'TypeSig' provides multiple 'type parser' methods as listed below:

  - 'fast':  Strict, but fast hash-based parsing. This method will always
  return processed arguments identical to received call arguments when
  hashes match. Otherwise, it raises 'HashMismatch'.

  - 'cast'(**):  Applies type casting to each call argument not exactly
  matching the corresponding type. If any argument fails to cast,
  it raises 'CastMismatch' (a subclass of 'HashMismatch'). Otherwise,
  the type-casted arguments are passed to the 'fast' method described
  above to ensure type exactness. Please note that both this and 'flex'
  described below, are not appropriate for performance-sensitive
  applications, requiring substantial overhead compared to 'fast'.

  - 'flex'(**):  This method attempts to find a permutation of the call
  arguments that it might be able to cast. Additionally, if none of its
  raw types are 'list' or 'tuple', it will unpack any iterable call
  argument. If at all possible, the processed arguments will pass through
  the 'fast' method described above. Otherwise, it raises 'FlexMismatch' (
  a subclass of 'CastMismatch').

  (*) Note that 'TypeSig' objects are hashable only after the 'THIS'
  sentinel has been replaced with the appropriate class or a more specific
  hash-aware placeholder. 'worktoy' assigns to each class a hash value
  that depends only on names known ahead of actual class creation. This
  allows 'THIS' to be replaced with a 'PreClass' object having identical
  hash.

  (**) Note that 'TypeSig' parsing methods 'cast' and 'flex' do not
  support 'THIS', when used to overload the constructor of the class to
  which 'THIS' refers. The 'worktoy.static.Dispatch' class responsible for
  dispatching calls are meant to explicitly skip both 'cast' and 'flex'
  for this case. Since the 'TypeSig' object has no awareness of the
  broader context, it cannot detect and prevent this case. The 'cast' and
  'flex' methods will raise 'SignatureRecursion'

  #  ROLE IN LIBRARY
  The 'worktoy' library uses 'TypeSig' to provide function overloading.
  When the '@overload(...)' decorator receives types and decorates a
  function, it instantiates a 'TypeSig' object and associates the
  decorated function object with it. Please note that during class
  creation, methods created with 'def ...' begin as 'function' objects.
  They only become bound methods during the class creation process. Thus,
  any function decorator in Python is certain to receive a 'function
  object'. Even if this object later becomes a bound method.

  The 'worktoy' library leverages metaclass customization to facilitate
  function overloading. It uses the 'TypeSig' class when deciding which
  function object to dispatch. For more details, see the 'worktoy.mcls'
  documentation.
