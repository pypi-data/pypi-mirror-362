Also make sure to have at least 2 nodes between adjacent electrodes.\nEven when using mixed-boundary conditions, make sure to add enough space towards the nearest non-surface boundary. As a rule of thumb, use at least 2 electrode distances.\nMake sure to add enough depth (z-direction) to the mesh. The absolute minimum is 0.2 * maximum electrode distance."
