# Quaestor Commands Overview

*Command system with Claude integration and orchestration*

## Command Architecture

### Intelligence Features
All Quaestor commands include these patterns:
- **Auto-activation**: Context-aware triggers and intelligent thresholds

- **Quality gates**: Integrated validation cycles with zero-tolerance fixing
- **Milestone integration**: Automatic progress tracking and completion detection
- **Token efficiency**: Symbol system for 30-50% token reduction

### YAML Frontmatter Standard
```yaml

```

### üöÄ Automation Commands

#### `/auto-commit` - Intelligent Commit Generation
**Purpose**: Automatically create conventional commits when TODOs are completed.

**Intelligence**: Todo-completion-detection, commit-generation, milestone-tracking
**Profile**: Optimization (0.3 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Conventional commit spec with intelligent type/scope detection

```bash
/auto-commit
/auto-commit --dry-run --todo-id 42
```

#### `/project-init` - Framework-Aware Project Setup
**Purpose**: Analyze project architecture, detect frameworks, and generate intelligent Quaestor setup.

**Intelligence**: Framework-detection, pattern-analysis, adaptive-setup
**Profile**: Complex (0.6 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Stack analysis (React|Django|Express|FastAPI|Axum)
- Architecture pattern detection (MVC|DDD|VSA|Microservices)
- Adaptive milestone generation based on project maturity

```bash
/project-init
/project-init --type web-api --existing
```

## Intelligence Patterns

### Performance Profiles
- **Standard (0.2-0.4)**: Simple tasks, direct execution, basic validation
- **Optimization (0.4-0.6)**: Quality-focused, fast validation, parallel fixing
- **Complex (0.6-0.8)**: Multi-agent coordination, systematic approach, evidence-based

### Auto-Activation Triggers
- **Context detection**: Project type, framework, architecture patterns
- **Quality gates**: Test status, linting compliance, build health
- **Milestone integration**: Progress tracking, completion detection
- **Orchestration**: Tool selection, agent spawning, parallel execution

### Validation Cycles
```
Execute ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Fix (if ‚ùå) ‚Üí Re-validate ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete
```

## Symbol System

### Core Flow
- `‚Üí` leads to, implies
- `‚áí` transforms to  
- `‚úÖ` completed, passed
- `‚ùå` failed, error
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` warning
- `‚ö°` performance, optimization
- `üîç` analysis, investigation
- `üìä` metrics, data
- `üéØ` target, goal

### Workflow Patterns
```
üîç Analysis ‚Üí üìã Planning ‚Üí ‚ö° Implementation ‚Üí ‚úÖ Validation
```
