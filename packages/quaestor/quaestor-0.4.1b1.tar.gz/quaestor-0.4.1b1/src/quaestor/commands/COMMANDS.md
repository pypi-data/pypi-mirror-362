```bash
/status
/status --verbose --milestone current
```

### 🎯 Milestone Management Commands

#### `/milestone` - Intelligent Milestone Management
**Purpose**: Create or complete milestones with evidence-based validation and automated progress tracking.

**Intelligence**: Completion-detection, evidence-validation, progress-tracking
**Profile**: Standard (0.3 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Readiness assessment with quality gates
- Smart archiving with auto-categorization
- Next phase planning based on velocity analysis

```bash
/milestone --create "MVP Complete"
/milestone --complete
```

#### `/milestone-pr` - Automated PR Creation
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive PRs for completed milestones with auto-detection and validation.

**Intelligence**: Milestone-validation, commit-analysis, pr-generation
**Profile**: Standard (0.4 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Completion detection with conflict checking
- Auto-commit discovery and categorization
- Intelligent PR generation with reviewer detection

```bash
/milestone-pr
/milestone-pr --milestone "phase-1-auth" --draft
```

### 🚀 Automation Commands

#### `/auto-commit` - Intelligent Commit Generation
**Purpose**: Automatically create conventional commits when TODOs are completed.

**Intelligence**: Todo-completion-detection, commit-generation, milestone-tracking
**Profile**: Optimization (0.3 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Conventional commit spec with intelligent type/scope detection
- Smart file staging with quality gates
- Hook integration for automatic TODO completion triggers

```bash
/auto-commit
/auto-commit --dry-run --todo-id 42
```

#### `/project-init` - Framework-Aware Project Setup
**Purpose**: Analyze project architecture, detect frameworks, and generate intelligent Quaestor setup.

**Intelligence**: Framework-detection, pattern-analysis, adaptive-setup
**Profile**: Complex (0.6 threshold)
**Key Features**:
- Stack analysis (React|Django|Express|FastAPI|Axum)
- Architecture pattern detection (MVC|DDD|VSA|Microservices)
- Adaptive milestone generation based on project maturity

```bash
/project-init
/project-init --type web-api --existing
```

## Intelligence Patterns

### Performance Profiles
- **Standard (0.2-0.4)**: Simple tasks, direct execution, basic validation
- **Optimization (0.4-0.6)**: Quality-focused, fast validation, parallel fixing
- **Complex (0.6-0.8)**: Multi-agent coordination, systematic approach, evidence-based

### Auto-Activation Triggers
- **Context detection**: Project type, framework, architecture patterns
- **Quality gates**: Test status, linting compliance, build health
- **Milestone integration**: Progress tracking, completion detection
- **Orchestration**: Tool selection, agent spawning, parallel execution

### Validation Cycles
```
Execute → Validate → Fix (if ❌) → Re-validate → ✅ Complete
```

## Symbol System

### Core Flow
- `→` leads to, implies
- `⇒` transforms to  
- `✅` completed, passed
- `❌` failed, error
- `⚠️` warning
- `⚡` performance, optimization
- `🔍` analysis, investigation
- `📊` metrics, data
- `🎯` target, goal

### Workflow Patterns
```
🔍 Analysis → 📋 Planning → ⚡ Implementation → ✅ Validation
```
