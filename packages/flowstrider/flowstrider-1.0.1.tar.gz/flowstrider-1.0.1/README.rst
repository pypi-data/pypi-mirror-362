FlowStrider is an architectural threat modeling tool designed to support the identification, mitigation, documentation, and management of threats in a given software system.

**Why use FlowStrider?**

* Enables **continuous threat modeling**
* **Automates** key parts of the threat modeling process
* Follows a **practice-oriented workflow** inspired by real-world use cases
* Easily integrates into **CI/CD pipelines**
* Programming-language agnostic
* Fully **scriptable and extensible**

Features
=============

ðŸ›   **Refine System Representation:** Assists in adding relevant information to the system representation to enhance the quality of analysis.


ðŸ›¡ **Identification of Threats:** Uses two built-in threat catalogs to identify threats based on the system representation.


ðŸ“Š **Reporting:** Supports the documentation and management of identified threats in a structured report.


Documentation
=============

For the full documentation of the FlowStrider tool, please visit the `GitLab page <https://flowstrider-defe6e.gitlab.io/>`_ or build the documentation locally (using ``tox -e docs``).


Installation
============

As a prerequisite, FlowStrider requires Python (tested with versions 3.10 and 3.12) and Graphviz, which can be installed via ``apt install graphviz`` or as described on their `website <https://graphviz.org/>`_.

Install the tool directly using ``pip install flowstrider`` or clone this repository and install it (using ``git clone`` and ``pip install``).
Dependencies are handled automatically during the installation process as defined in `setup.cfg`.

Usage
=====

1. **Threat elicitation**

  FlowStrider takes a system representation as input in the form of a data flow graph in json file format (example see below).
  This data flow graph is then used to identify potential threats.

  .. code-block:: python

      flowstrider elicit dataflow_graph.json [--output (off|pdf)]
                                             [--management-path management-file-path]
                                             [--fail-on-threat (off|undecided|todo|all)]
                                             [--out-lang (en|de)]

  The results can be saved as a PDF file using ``[--output pdf] (default=off)``. The PDF
  includes a visual representation of the graph generated with GraphViz and details about the identified threats.

  The ``[--management-path]`` gives the path to a json file where information about the
  management state of each existing threat can be modified. If the file doesn't exist
  yet, it will be created.

  If ``[--fail-on-threat] (default=off)`` is set to off, the tool will not fail if it
  finds threats. If set to other options, the tool will fail if there is a threat with
  an unsufficient management state to explain its presence with the set fail option.

  By default, each found threat is asigned the management state ``Undecided``. The
  management state can be modified in the management file indicated by the
  ``[--management-path]`` option. There are seven different states each threat can take
  on as seen in the left column in the table below. The table also shows which state
  will fail the tool if run with a specific option for the ``[--fail-on-threat]``
  argument.

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 20 20 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * -
      - off
      - undecided
      - todo
      - all
    * - Undecided
      - pass
      - **fail**
      - **fail**
      - **fail**
    * - Delegate
      - pass
      - pass
      - **fail**
      - **fail**
    * - Mitigate
      - pass

      - **fail**
      - **fail**
    * - Avoid
      - pass
      - pass
      - **fail**
      - **fail**
    * - Accept
      - pass
      - pass
      - pass
      - **fail**
    * - Delegated
      - pass
      - pass
      - pass
      - **fail**
    * - Mitigated
      - pass
      - pass
      - pass
      - **fail**

  The parameter ``[--out-lang] (default=en)`` denotes the output language used for the
  threats and the report.


2. **Missing Metadata overview**

  The tool relies on metadata (stored in the attributes property of the nodes and edges) to accurately elicit threats.
  An .xlsx file can be generated to get an overview of the attributes stored in the metadata, as well as any relevant attributes that are missing.

  .. code-block:: python

      flowstrider metadata dataflow_graph.json [--out-lang (en|de)]

  The parameter ``[--out-lang] (default=en)`` denotes the output language used for the
  threats and the pdf.

3. **Updating Metadata using the xlsx overview**

  After filling out the missing metadata in the xlsx file, that file can be used to
  update the existing json file of the dataflow graph. The modified and added
  attributes are then being updated as properties to the nodes and edges of the graph.

  .. code-block:: python

      flowstrider update dataflow_graph.json metadata_overview.xlsx

Creating a System Representation
================================

FlowStrider takes a system representation as input in the form of a data flow graph in json file format.
See the Data Flow Graph section in the documentation for more information on how do define elements and assign attributes.
In the tags of the dfd at the bottom of the json file, one can define the threat catalogs the tool is checking against.
Currently, there are the threat catalogs *stride* and *bsi_rules*.

Here is a minimal example of such a dataflow graph in .json:

.. code-block:: JSON

  {
    "dfd": {
      "id": "Example",
      "nodes": {
        "node1": {
          "id": "node1",
          "name": "User",
          "tags": [
            "STRIDE:Interactor"
          ],
          "attributes": {}
        },
        "node2": {
          "id": "node2",
          "name": "Application",
          "tags": [
            "STRIDE:Process"
          ],
          "attributes": {}
        }
      },
      "edges": {
        "edge1": {
          "id": "edge1",
          "source_id": "node1",
          "sink_id": "node2",
          "name": "http_request",
          "tags": [
            "STRIDE:Dataflow"
          ],
          "attributes": {}
        }
      },
      "clusters": {
        "cluster1":{
          "id": "cluster1",
          "node_ids": [
            "node2"
          ],
          "name": "Internet",
          "tags": [
            "STRIDE:TrustBoundary"
          ],
          "attributes": {}
        }
      },
      "name": "",
      "tags": [
        "bsi_rules"
      ],
      "attributes": {}
    }
  }
