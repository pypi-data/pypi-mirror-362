    Invert the De Zan soil moisture model and predict soil moisture from interferometric parameters (coherence and triplets).
    The provided initial soil moisture values are iteratively adjusted until a combination is found that best explains the
    observed interferometric parameters. In addition, one soil moisture value must be known.
    The model works on a time series with N acquisitions, where each aquaition has its own id.
    Each acquisition must have the same number of points (same batch shape B).
    Input:
        coherence_dict - dictionary that contains the observed complex coherence values
                         (aquisition_id_1, aquisition_id_2) -> complex coherence, numpy array of shape (*B,)

                                aquisition_id -> initial soil moisture, numpy array of shape (*B,)
        known_sm_aquisition_id - the acquisition id of the moisture values that are assumed to be known
                                 those values are kept constant during the optimization
        incidence - incidence angle, numpy array of shape (*B,) or a scalar
        sand - soil sand content in percent (value from 0 to 100), numpy array of shape (*B,) or a scalar
        clay - soil clay content in percent (value from 0 to 100), numpy array of shape (*B,) or a scalar
