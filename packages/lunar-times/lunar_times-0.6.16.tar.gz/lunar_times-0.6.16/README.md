A command-line Python application that calculates moonrise and moonset times for any location. The application integrates with external APIs to provide accurate astronomical data with proper timezone handling.

## Features

- üåô Calculate moonrise and moonset times for any US city and state
- üìç Automatic coordinate resolution using OpenStreetMap geocoding
- üïê Timezone-aware calculations with proper daylight saving time handling
- üîß Debug mode for development and testing
- üöÄ Clean command-line interface with clear output formatting
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-grade CI/CD** with automated testing across multiple Python versions and platforms

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run the application
make run

# Or use debug mode (defaults to El Paso, TX)
make run-debug

# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make check
```

## Example Usage

```bash
$ lunar-times
Enter the city: Austin
Enter the state: TX
# Moon rise/set times in (Timezone: America/Chicago -6.0) on 2024-01-15:
-  RISE: 10:45 PM
-  SET: 11:30 AM
```
