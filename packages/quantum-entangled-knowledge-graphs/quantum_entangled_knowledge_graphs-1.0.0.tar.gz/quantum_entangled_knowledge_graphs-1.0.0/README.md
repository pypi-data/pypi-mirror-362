> 🚀 **World's First Open-Source Library** for quantum-enhanced knowledge graph reasoning using entanglement principles

## 🧠 What is QE-KGR?

QE-KGR (Quantum Entangled Knowledge Graph Reasoning) revolutionizes how we represent and reason over complex knowledge by applying quantum mechanics principles to graph theory. Unlike classical knowledge graphs, QE-KGR enables:

- **Quantum Superposition** of multiple relations simultaneously
- **Entanglement-based reasoning** for discovering hidden connections
- **Interference patterns** for enhanced link prediction
- **Non-classical logic** for handling uncertainty and context

## ⚛️ Core Features

### 🔗 Entangled Graph Representation

- Nodes as quantum states (density matrices/ket vectors)
- Edges as entanglement tensors with superposed relations
- Tensor network representation for efficient computation

### 🧮 Quantum Inference Engine

- Quantum walks for graph traversal
- Grover-like search for subgraph discovery
- Interference-based link prediction
- Entanglement entropy measurements

### 🔍 Quantum Query Processing

- Vector-based semantic queries
- Hilbert space projections
- Superposed query chains
- Context-aware reasoning

### 📊 Advanced Visualization

- Interactive entangled graph visualization
- Entropy heatmaps and quantum state projections
- Real-time inference path highlighting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install quantum-entangled-knowledge-graphs
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import qekgr
from qekgr.graphs import EntangledGraph
from qekgr.reasoning import QuantumInference
from qekgr.query import EntangledQueryEngine

# Create an entangled knowledge graph
graph = EntangledGraph()

# Add quantum nodes and entangled edges
alice = graph.add_quantum_node("Alice", state="physicist")
bob = graph.add_quantum_node("Bob", state="researcher")
graph.add_entangled_edge(alice, bob, relations=["collaborates", "mentors"], 
                        amplitudes=[0.8, 0.6])

# Initialize quantum reasoning engine
inference_engine = QuantumInference(graph)

# Perform quantum walk-based reasoning
result = inference_engine.quantum_walk(start_node=alice, steps=10)

# Query with entanglement-based search
query_engine = EntangledQueryEngine(graph)
answers = query_engine.query("Who might Alice collaborate with in quantum research?")
```
