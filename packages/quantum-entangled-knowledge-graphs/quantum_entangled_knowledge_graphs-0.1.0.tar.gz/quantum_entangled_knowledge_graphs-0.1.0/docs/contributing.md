## 📏 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive names
def calculate_quantum_state_overlap(state_a: np.ndarray, state_b: np.ndarray) -> complex:
    """Calculate overlap between two quantum states."""
    return np.vdot(state_a, state_b)

# Good: Type hints for all functions
class EntangledGraph:
    def __init__(self, hilbert_dim: int = 8) -> None:
        self.hilbert_dim = hilbert_dim
        self.nodes: Dict[str, QuantumNode] = {}

# Good: Comprehensive docstrings
def quantum_walk(
    self, 
    start_node: str, 
    steps: int,
    bias_relations: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> QuantumWalkResult:
    """Perform quantum walk on the entangled graph.
    
    Args:
        start_node: Starting node for the walk
        steps: Number of quantum walk steps
        bias_relations: Relations to bias the walk towards
        
    Returns:
        QuantumWalkResult containing path and probabilities
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If start_node not in graph
    """
```

### Quantum Computing Conventions
- Use complex numbers for quantum amplitudes
- Normalize quantum states appropriately
- Include uncertainty measures in results
- Document quantum mechanics assumptions clearly

### Documentation Standards
- Every public function/class needs docstring
- Include type hints for all parameters and returns
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Document quantum mechanics concepts used

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```python

import numpy as np
from qekgr import EntangledGraph, QuantumInference

class TestQuantumInference:
    """Test suite for quantum inference algorithms."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.graph = EntangledGraph(hilbert_dim=4)
        self.inference = QuantumInference(self.graph)
    
    def test_quantum_walk_basic(self):
        """Test basic quantum walk functionality."""
        # Setup
        self.graph.add_quantum_node("A", "state_a")
        self.graph.add_quantum_node("B", "state_b")
        self.graph.add_entangled_edge("A", "B", ["connects"], [0.8])
        
        # Execute
        result = self.inference.quantum_walk("A", steps=5)
        
        # Assert
        assert result.path[0] == "A"
        assert len(result.path) == 6  # steps + 1
        assert 0 <= result.final_probability <= 1
    
    def test_quantum_state_normalization(self):
        """Test quantum state normalization."""
        state = np.array([1+2j, 3-1j, 2+0j])
        normalized = self.inference._normalize_quantum_state(state)
        
        # State should be normalized
        assert np.isclose(np.linalg.norm(normalized), 1.0)
```
