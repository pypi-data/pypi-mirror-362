# MCP Usage Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples showing how to use the blender-remote MCP server with LLM-powered IDEs.

## Overview

These examples demonstrate:
- **Basic Operations**: Scene inspection, object creation, code execution
- **Data Persistence**: Stateful workflows and cross-command data storage
- **Advanced Workflows**: Complex scene creation, animation setup, material creation
- **LLM Integration**: Effective prompting patterns and interaction examples
- **Error Handling**: How to handle errors gracefully in LLM workflows
- **Best Practices**: Optimal usage patterns and performance considerations

## Prerequisites

## Running Examples

### With LLM IDE
1. Copy the example prompts into your LLM conversation
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. Observe the results in Blender

### Direct Testing
```bash
# Test MCP server directly
pixi run python -m blender_remote.mcp_server

# Use specific examples
pixi run python -c "from examples.mcp_usage.basic_operations import *; run_example()"
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting
- **Be Specific**: "Create a blue metallic cube at (2, 0, 0)" vs "add object"
- **Use Context**: "Based on the current scene, add complementary lighting"
- **Iterate**: Build complex scenes step by step
- **Verify**: Always ask for screenshots to confirm results

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Operations**: Group related commands in single requests
- **Efficient Queries**: Use specific object queries instead of full scene dumps
- **Screenshot Management**: Use appropriate sizes for your needs
- **Connection Management**: Let the MCP server handle connections

### Error Handling
- **Check Connection**: Start with connection status check
- **Handle Modes**: Account for GUI vs background mode differences
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide alternatives when features unavailable
- **Clear Messages**: Use error messages to guide next steps

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Example doesn't work:**
- Verify Blender is running with BLD_Remote_MCP addon
- Check MCP server configuration in your IDE
- Test connection with `uvx blender-remote status`

**Screenshots failing:**
- Ensure Blender is in GUI mode (not `--background`)
- Check if viewport is visible and active
- Try smaller screenshot sizes first

**Code execution errors:**
- Verify Python syntax in code blocks
- Check for typos in object names
- Ensure objects exist before referencing them

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**: [MCP Server Guide](../../docs/mcp-server.md)
2. **Test Direct Connection**: Use CLI tools to verify functionality
3. **Review Logs**: Check Blender console for error messages
4. **Community Support**: Use GitHub discussions for questions
