## Etymology
Because this package targets so-called "abundance" data from ecology, it has been named
using the corresponding Latin term *copia*. The artwork for the logo has been kindly
contributed by Dr. Lauren Fonteyn (Leiden University, NL). The depicted goat is a
mythological reference to the [cornucopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopia) or
"horn of plenty", the legendary horn of the goat Amaltheia, who fed the infant Zeus with
her milk.
