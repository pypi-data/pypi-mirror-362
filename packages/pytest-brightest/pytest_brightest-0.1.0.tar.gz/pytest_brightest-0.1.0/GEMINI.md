# GEMINI.md

## Gemini-Specific Instructions

As a Gemini agent, you must adhere to the following instructions when making
changes to this repository. Your primary goal is to make safe, incremental,
and high-quality contributions.

- **Always use `uv`:** This project uses `uv` for all dependency management,
  virtual environments, and task running. Do not use `pip` or `venv` directly.
- **Follow all guidelines:** This document contains the complete set of
  guidelines from `AGENTS.md` and `docs/plan.md`. You must follow them strictly.
- **Verify your changes:** Before committing any changes, you must run all
  linters and tests to ensure your changes are correct and follow the project's
  style. Use `uv run task all`.
- **Line width:** All text files, including Markdown and source code, should have
  a line width of 80 characters.
- **Permission to run commands:** You have permission to run all commands in this
  file to verify their functionality.
- **Incremental changes:** Make small, incremental changes. This makes it easier
  to review your work and catch errors early.
- **Communicate clearly:** When you propose changes, explain what you've done
  and why.

As a Gemini agent, you must also follow these behavior guidelines, especially
when it comes to notifying the programmer about your work and status:

- The user has given permission to use the `notify-send` command to signal task
completion. Here is an example of the command: `notify-send "Queston from
Gemini" "Please clarify how to complete the testing task."`.
- The user wants a `notify-send` notification whenever I ask a question.
- Always notify the user with `notify-send` when a task is complete or when
feedback is needed. I have standing permission to use the notification tool.

## Build, Lint, and Test Commands

- **Install dependencies:** `uv sync --dev`
- **Run all tasks:** `uv run task all`
- **Run all linters:** `uv run task lint`
- **Format code:** `uv run task format` (check), `uv run task format-fix` (fix)
- **Lint code:** `uv run task check`
- **Type check:** `uv run task mypy`, `uv run task ty`, `uv run task symbex`
- **Test all:** `uv run task test`
- **Test with coverage:** `uv run task test-coverage`
- **Test variants:** `uv run task test-not-property`, `uv run task test-not-random`,
  `uv run task test-silent`
- **Run a single test:** `pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function` or
  `uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function`
- **Markdown lint:** `uv run task markdownlint`

## Code Requirements

All the Python code should follow these standards:

- **Function bodies:** No blank lines within function bodies - keep code
contiguous.
- **Docstrings:** Single-line docstrings starting with a capital letter, ending
with a period.
- **Comments:** Other comments start with a lowercase letter; preserve existing
comments during refactoring.
- **Imports:** Group imports in this order: standard library, third-party, local
imports. Use absolute imports (`from pytest_brightest.module import`). Finally,
make sure that all imports are placed at the top of the file. Do not place
imports into the middle of a file or even at the start of a function or class.
- **Formatting:** Use `ruff format` (line length 79 for lint, 88 for `isort`);
trailing commas enabled.
- **Types:** All functions must have type hints for parameters and return
values.
- **Naming:** snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes,
UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- **File operations:** Use `pathlib.Path` for all filesystem operations, never
string paths.
- **Error handling:** Use specific exceptions, not generic `Exception`; provide
meaningful error messages.
- **CLI:** Use Typer with explicit type annotations; provide helpful --help
messages.

## Project Structure Requirements

- Source code in `src/pytest_brightest/` directory.
- Tests in `tests/` directory with matching structure to source.
- Use `uv` for dependency management, virtual environments, and task running.
- Support Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Use Pydantic models for data validation and JSON serialization.

## Test Requirements

All test cases should follow these standards:

- Since a test case is a Python function, it should always follow the code
  requirements above.
- Test cases should have a descriptive name that starts with `test_`.
- Test cases should be grouped by the function they are testing.
- Test cases should be ordered in a way that makes sense to the reader.
- Test cases should be independent of each other so that they can be run in a
  random order without affecting the results or each other.
- Test cases must work both on a local machine and in a CI environment.
- Test cases should aim to achieve full function, statement, and branch
  coverage.
- Property-based tests must be marked with `@pytest.mark.property`.

## Making Changes

1. **Understand:** Thoroughly understand the request and the relevant codebase.
   Use the available tools to explore the code.
2. **Plan:** Formulate a clear plan before making any changes.
3. **Implement:** Make small, incremental changes.
4. **Verify:** Run `uv run task all` to ensure your changes are correct and
   follow the project's style.
5. **Commit:** Write a clear and concise commit message explaining the "why" of
   your changes.
6. **Rules**: Always follow the rules in this file and in the `docs/plan.md`
   file.
7. **Completion**: When you are finished with tasks, please summarize what tasks
   you completed, how you completed them, the challenges you faced, how you
   overcame them, and the rules that you followed during completion of the tasks.
