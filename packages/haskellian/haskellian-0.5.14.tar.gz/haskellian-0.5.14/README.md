# Haskellian

> The python functional programming library you need

```bash
pip install haskellian
```

- **Zero import time**: modules are lazy-loaded
- **Static typing**: Haskellian makes deep use of typing and generics, giving you great IDE and type-checker support
- **Ergonomic**: Haskellian uses method-chaining style and strives for ergomonics over purity
