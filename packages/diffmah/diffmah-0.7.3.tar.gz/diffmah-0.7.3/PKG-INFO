## Project data
Data for this project can be found [at this URL](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/hacc/aphearin/diffmah_data/).

## Documentation
Online documentation for Diffmah is available at [diffmah.readthedocs.io](https://diffmah.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Scripts and demo notebooks
The `diffmah_fitter_demo.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to fit the MAH of a simulated halo with a diffmah approximation. See `history_fitting_script.py` for an example of how to fit the MAHs of a large number of simulated halos in parallel with mpi4py.
