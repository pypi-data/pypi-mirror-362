    Composer is a DSL for constructing automated trading strategies. It can only enter long positions and cannot stay in cash.

    ### Available Data
    - US Equity Adjusted Close prices and Crypto prices (daily granularity at 4PM ET)

    Before creating a symphony, check with the user for the asset classes they want to use.
    Assume equities are the default asset class.
    Note that symphonies with both equities and crypto must use daily or threshold (rebalance=None) rebalancing.

    After calling this tool, attempt to visualize the symphony using any other functionality at your disposal.
    If you can't visualize the symphony, resort to a mermaid diagram.

    """
    You have access to a database of Composer symphonies with the following statistics:
    - calmar_ratio
    - cumulative_return
    - max_drawdown
    - sharpe_ratio
    - standard_deviation
    - trailing_one_month_return
    - trailing_three_month_return
    - trailing_one_year_return

    Each of these statistics is calculated over 6 different variants:
    - oos - out of sample (backtest range)
    - oos_spy - performance of SPY over the OOS period
    - oos_btcusd - performance of BTC/USD over the OOS period
    - train - training period (all data before the OOS period)
    - train_spy - performance of SPY over the training period
    - train_btcusd - performance of BTC/USD over the training period

    If you prefix a statistic with "oos_", it is the value of that statistic for the symphony over the OOS period.
    The same applies for "train_", "oos_spy_", "oos_btcusd_", etc.

    Some other statistics that don't follow this pattern are:
    - num_backtest_days - number of calendar days in the backtest range
      - only has oos_ and train_ variants
    - alpha, beta, pearson_r, r_square
      - only has oos_spy_, oos_btcusd_, train_spy_, and train_btcusd_ variants b/c they are comparing the symphony to SPY and BTC/USD
    - num_node_asset, num_node_filter, num_node_group, num_node_if, num_node_if_child, num_node_wt_cash_equal, num_node_wt_cash_specified, num_node_wt_inverse_vol
        - no variants because they are just counts of the number of nodes of each type in the symphony.

    The arguments where, order_by, and offset all follow HoneySQL (Clojure) syntax.
    Use offset to paginate through the results. The limit is set to 5.

    Example:
    - Find symphonies with more than 1 year of OOS backtest data
      and annualized return greater than SPY's in both OOS and training periods
      and max drawdown lower than BTC's in both OOS and training periods
      and oos annualized return greater than 20% (i.e., 0.2)
      Sort by OOS cumulative return descending:
      where: ["and",
                [">", "oos_num_backtest_days", 180],
                [">", "oos_annualized_rate_of_return", "oos_spy_annualized_rate_of_return"],
                [">", "train_annualized_rate_of_return", "train_spy_annualized_rate_of_return"],
                ["<", "oos_max_drawdown", "oos_btcusd_max_drawdown"],
                ["<", "train_max_drawdown", "train_btcusd_max_drawdown"]]
      order_by: [["oos_cumulative_return", "desc"]]

    Tips for finding good symphonies:
    - We want to avoid overfit symphonies.
        - A symphony is likely overfit if its OOS performance is much worse than its training performance.
    - Generally we want returns to beat SPY but risk to be lower than BTC.
        - Ex: ["and",
              [">" "oos_annualized_rate_of_return", "oos_spy_annualized_rate_of_return"],
              ["<" "oos_max_drawdown", "oos_btcusd_max_drawdown"]]
    - Generally we want small symphonies.
        - A good heuristic is to look for symphonies with fewer than 50 IF and FILTER nodes.
        - A symphony with fewer than 10 IF and FILTER nodes is particularly small and worth calling out if it has strong performance.

    Before calling this tool, try to understand the user's appetite for risk relative to the S&P 500 and Bitcoin.
    Are they willing to take on Bitcoin-levels of risk for similar returns, or do they prefer similar risk to S&P 500, or even lower?

    Always include the symphony_url in your response so the user can click on it to view the symphony in more detail.
