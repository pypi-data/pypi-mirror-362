  <strong>Vibe Trading is here!</strong>

<p align="center">
  Official <a href="https://www.composer.trade">Composer</a> Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows MCP-enabled LLMs like Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenAI Agents and others to validate investment ideas via backtests and even trade multiple strategies (called "symphonies") in parallel to compare their live performance.
</p>

## Features
- **Create automated investing strategies**
  - Use indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average (MA), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with a diverse range of equity and crypto offerings to build your ideal portfolio.
  - Don't just make one-off trades. Composer symphonies constantly monitor the market and rebalance accordingly.
  - Try asking Claude: "_Build me a crypto strategy with a maximum drawdown of 30% or less._"
- **Backtest your ideas**
  - Our Backtesting API provides a fast feedback loop for AI to iterate and validate its hypotheses.
  - Try asking Claude: "_Compare the strategy's performance against the S&P 500. Plot the results._"
- **Find a strategy tailored for you**
  - Provide your criteria to the AI and it will search through our database of 1000+ strategies to find one that suits your needs.
  - Try asking Claude: "_Find me a strategy with better risk-reward characteristics than Bitcoin._"
- **Monitor performance** (requires [API Key](https://github.com/invest-composer/composer-trade-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-your-api-key))
  - View performance statistics for your overall account as well as for individual symphonies.
  - Try asking Claude: "_Identify my best-performing symphonies. Analyze why they are working._"
- **Control your investments** (requires API Key + [Composer subscription](https://www.composer.trade/pricing))
  - Ask AI to analyze your investments and adjust your exposure accordingly!
  - Try asking Claude: "_Research the latest trends and news. Analyze my symphonies and determine whether I should increase / decrease my investments._"

‼️ **WARNING: Composer's symphony schema takes up nearly all of the available context window on Claude's free plan. Please upgrade your Anthropic plan to get the full benefit of the MCP server.** ‼️

## Quickstart with Claude Desktop
This section will get you started with creating symphonies and backtesting them.
You don't even need a Composer account to use these features!

Note that other tools will require an [API Key](https://github.com/invest-composer/composer-trade-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-your-api-key).

1. Make sure you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or higher).
   - Check your version by running `python3 --version` in the terminal.
1. Install `uv` (Python package manager) with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or see the `uv` [repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for additional install methods.
1. Download [composer-trade-mcp.dxt](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.investcomposer.com/downloads/composer-trade-mcp.dxt)
1. Go to Claude > Settings > Extensions then drag the `composer-trade-mcp.dxt` file into the window.

</div>

4. Click "Install"
    - You can choose to add your [API Key](https://github.com/invest-composer/composer-trade-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-your-api-key) here for more advanced features but it's not necessary for backtesting.
1. That's it. Your MCP client can now interact with Composer! Try asking Claude something like, "_Create and backtest a basic 60-40 strategy._"

## Manual install
If the approach above did not work or your AI client doesn't support DXT, you can try the following:

1. Make sure you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or higher).
   - Check your version by running `python3 --version` in the terminal.
1. Install `uv` (Python package manager) with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or see the `uv` [repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for additional install methods.
1. Open your Terminal and run `which uvx`
1. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "composer": {
      "command": "uvx",  <--------- Replace "uvx" with the result of `which uvx` in the prior step
      "args": [
        "composer-trade-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
4. Close and re-open Claude and you can now interact with Composer!

## Getting your API Key

An API key will be necessary to interact with your Composer account. For example, saving a Composer Symphony for later or viewing statistics about your portfolio.

Trading a symphony will require a paid subscription, although you can always liquidate a position regardless of your subscription status. Composer also includes a 14-day free trial so you can try without any commitment.

Get your API key from [Composer](https://app.composer.trade) by following these steps:

1. If you haven't already done so, [create an account](https://app.composer.trade/register).
1. Open your "Accounts & Funding" page

1. Request an API key

   </div>
1. Depending on how you installed the Composer MCP server, do the following:
    1. If you installed via `composer-trade-mcp.dxt`:
        - Go to Claude > Settings > Extensions > Composer MCP Server > Configure
        - Add your API Key and Secret
    1. If you installed via `claude_desktop_config.json`:
        - Modify your `claude_desktop_config.json` to include your API key and secret:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "composer": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "composer-trade-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "COMPOSER_API_KEY": "<insert-your-api-key-here>",
        "COMPOSER_SECRET_KEY": "<insert-your-api-secret-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendations
We recommend the following for the best experience with Composer:
- Use Claude Opus 4 instead of Sonnet. Opus is much better at tool use.
- Turn on Claude's Research mode if you need the latest financial data and news.
- Tools that execute trades or affect your funds should only be allowed once. Do not set them to "Always Allow".
  - The following tools should be handled with care: `invest_in_symphony`, `withdraw_from_symphony`, `skip_automated_rebalance_for_symphony`, `go_to_cash_for_symphony`, `liquidate_symphony`, `rebalance_symphony_now`, `execute_single_trade`

## Troubleshooting

Logs when running with Claude Desktop can be found at:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-composer.log`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-composer.log`
