  Usually it would be good practice to make this a `dataclass(kw_only=True)`.
  However in this case, it's convenient to be able to use it like a
  `NamedTuple`, like:

  ```python
  state, timer, ds_iter = ckptr.restore(CheckpointState(state, timer, ds_iter))
  ```

  The indirection (`class CheckpointState(_CheckpointState)`) is required
  because Python doesn't support multi-inheritance with `NamedTuple`.
