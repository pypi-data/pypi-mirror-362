# Quantex

A simple quant strategy creation and back-testing package written in Python.  
Quantex aims to provide a lightweight foundation for building trading
strategies, ingesting historical market data, and evaluating performance –
all without the heavy overhead of larger, more opinionated quant libraries.

## Features
* **Data Abstraction** – A generic `DataSource` interface that you can
  subclass to plug in CSVs, Parquet files, live feeds, databases, etc.
* **Back-testing Support** – A `BacktestingDataSource` base class to drive
  offline simulations.
* **Strategy Skeleton** – Extendable `Strategy` base class for plug-and-play
  trading logic.
* **Core Data Models** – Immutable `Bar`, `Tick`, `Order`, `Fill`, plus
  stateful `Position` / `Portfolio` helpers for P&L accounting.
* **Black + Ruff Pre-commit** – `black` auto-formats and `ruff` lints every
  commit via *pre-commit* hooks, keeping the codebase consistent.
* **Python 3.13+** – Embraces the latest language features.
* **Poetry-managed** – Modern dependency management, packaging, and virtual
  environment handling.

> **Note:** The public API is still under heavy development and may change

## Installation
Quantex is managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Clone the
repository and install the dependencies in an isolated virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/dangreen07/quantex.git
$ cd quantex

# Install dependencies
$ poetry install
$ poetry build
$ pip install dist/quantex-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

This command will:
1. Create / activate a local virtual-env (unless Poetry is configured to use a
   global env).
2. Install package dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
3. Install Quantex itself in *editable* mode, so changes you make in `src/` are
   reflected immediately.

---

## Running Tests
Quantex uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for its test suite. After
installing the dev dependencies (`poetry install` above), simply run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You should see tests collect and run successfully. Ensure your editor uses the
Poetry virtual-env so import paths resolve correctly.

---

## Development
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
2. Write your code & tests.
3. Install the git hooks once per clone: `poetry run pre-commit install`.
   Hooks will run `black --check` and `ruff` automatically on every commit.
4. Ensure `poetry run pytest` passes and the pre-commit hooks are clean.
