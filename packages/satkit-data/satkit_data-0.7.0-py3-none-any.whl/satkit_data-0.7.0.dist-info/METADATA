# Satellite Tookit Data Package

This package contains necessary data files for the Satellite Toolkit, "satkit", python data package.

The files include:


* **leap-seconds.list** <br/>A list of the UTC leap seconds since 1972.  This is a common file in *nix platforms and is used to keep track of the number of seconds (currently 37) that UTC lags TAI
<br/>

* **linux_p1550p2650.440**<br>File containing the precice ephemerides of the planets and 400 large asteroids between the years 1550 and 2650, as modelled by the Jet Propulsion Laboraotry (JPL).  Note: this file is large -- approx. 100 MB.


* **tab5.2a.txt**, **tab5.2b.txt**, **tab5.2d.txt**<br> Tables from IERS Conventions Technical Note 36, containng coefficients used in the precice rotation between the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame and the Earth-fixed International Terrestrial Reference Frame.


* **EGM96.gfc**, **JGM2.gfc**, **JGM3.gfc**, **ITU-GRACE16.gfc**<br/>Files containing gravity coefficients for various gravity models.  These are used to compute the precise acceleration due to Earth gravity as a function of position in the Earth-fixed ITRF frame.


* **SW-All.csv**<br/>Space Weather.  The solar flux at $\lambda~=~10.7cm$ (2800 Mhz) is an indication of solar activity, which in turn is an important predictor of air density at altitudes relevant for low-Earth orbits.
This file is updated at [celestrack.org](https://www.celestrak.org) every 3 hours with the most-recent space weather information. 


* **EOP-All.csv**<br/>Earth orientation parameters.  This includes $\Delta UT1$, the difference between $UT1$ and $UTC$, as well as $x_p$ and $y_p$, the polar "wander" of the Earth rotation axis.  This file is updated daily with most-recent values at [celestrak.org](https://www.celestrak.org)
