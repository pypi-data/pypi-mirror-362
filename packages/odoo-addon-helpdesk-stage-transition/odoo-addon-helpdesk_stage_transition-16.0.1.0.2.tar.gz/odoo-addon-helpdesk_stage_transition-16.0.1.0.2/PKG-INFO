 Helpdesk Stage Transition
###########################

This module enhances the Odoo Helpdesk application by allowing
administrators to define specific, allowed transitions between ticket
stages. It also provides visual cues and interaction changes to enforce
these transitions.

 Overview
**********

The standard Odoo Helpdesk module allows users to move tickets between
any stages freely, including dragging and dropping in the Kanban view.
This module introduces a more controlled workflow by:

#. **Defining Allowed Transitions**: On each Helpdesk Ticket Stage, you
   can specify which other stages are valid "next stages".

#. **Dynamic Transition Buttons**: In the Helpdesk Ticket form view,
   instead of a selectable `Stage` field, buttons are dynamically
   generated in the header for each valid next stage based on the
   current stage's configuration. These buttons will always have a
   'primary' style.

#. **Restricting Stage Field**: The standard `Stage` field in the ticket
   form is made invisible and readonly, forcing users to use the
   transition buttons.

#. **Disabling Kanban Drag-and-Drop**: To maintain workflow integrity,
   dragging and dropping tickets between stages in the Kanban view is
   disabled.

#. **Visual Configuration for Stages**: In the list/tree view of
   Helpdesk Ticket Stages, new fields `Next Stages` are available for
   quick overview and configuration.

***************
 Configuration
***************

To configure stage transitions:

#. Navigate to `Helpdesk > Configuration > Stages`.

#. Select a stage to configure or create a new one.

#. In the form view, under the **Stage Transitions** section, you will
   find: * `Next stages`: A many2many field where you can select one or
   more stages that a ticket can transition to from the current stage.
   If no stages are selected here, any transition is implicitly allowed
   from this stage (standard Odoo behavior for this stage).

*******
 Usage
*******

-  **Ticket Form View**: * When a helpdesk ticket is in a particular
   stage, the header will display buttons corresponding to the `Next
   stages` configured for that current stage. * Clicking one of these
   buttons will move the ticket to the respective new stage. * The
   standard `Stage` field (dropdown or status bar) will not be directly
   editable through the usual means.

-  **Ticket Kanban View**: * Tickets cannot be dragged and dropped
   between columns (stages).

-  **Stage List/Tree View**: * Administrators can see the configured
   `Next Stages` directly in the list of stages.
