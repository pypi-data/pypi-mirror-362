This package, prepared by Lars Sonnenschein provides an extraction 
of the D0 Run II cone algorithm.

Check that the dependencies in the GNUmakefile match 
your platform/environment and modify if needed.

src/main.C 
is the source code of a test executable making use of the extracted version 
of the D0 Run II cone jet algorithm 
(it had to be slightly modified to remove the dependencies of many packages 
within the D0 software framework, but those modifications are not supposed 
to alter the behaviour of the algorithm in any way)

To produce the test executable do:
gmake main.exe

To run it do e.g.:
./main.exe
