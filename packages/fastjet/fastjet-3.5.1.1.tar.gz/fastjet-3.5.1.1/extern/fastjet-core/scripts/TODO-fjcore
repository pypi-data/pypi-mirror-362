TODO

- currenty the config_auto.h file is included and this reflects our
  local configuration (e.g. with many plugins enabled), even though
  the plugins aren't enabled.

  one option: run only from a suitably configured directory, and
  script gives error if plugins are indicated as enabled. 

  Alternative: script comments out any line with 
  #define FASTJET_ENABLE_PLUGIN

- somehow the banner says that the package uses Fortune's voronoi code
  + plugins, but actually these are gone from the core, and the
  COPYING file is also gone. Do we want to modify the banner

- what namespace: fastjet or fjcore?

- [do we really need the initial test build?]
