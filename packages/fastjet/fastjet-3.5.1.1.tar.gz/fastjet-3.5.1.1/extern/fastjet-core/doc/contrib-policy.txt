Draft policy for contrib
------------------------

- fastjet-contrib is a separate download with its own compilation
  system. 

- how do we handle versioning wrt FastJet? (E.g. minimum version
  needed)

- how do we handle versioning of contribs themselves?

- We have an open svn on hepforge? Within a fastjet project or a
  separate fastjet-contrib project?

- who provides the build system [autoscan?]

- what directory structure, e.g. refereed v. non-refereed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Guidelines
-----------------

- does it compile?
- does it come with an example program?
- does it run without error (including with valgrind)?
- are there any memory leaks?
- if it handles substructure, do the resulting jets have constituents?
- is it sufficiently (and correctly) documented [doxygen]?
