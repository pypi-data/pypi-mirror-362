# ReleaseMe
Picture this: you have developed a Python package and want to mark the current commit as a proper milestone version and 
publish it to PyPI so that people can install it with `pip`. How do you approach this?

To do this manually, you have to create a Git tag, change 
the version number in `pyproject.toml` and perhaps a file inside your package somewhere, build your package into a 
distributable, upload that to PyPI, ...

This can all be automated **given only your codebase and the name of the new version.**

## Installation
```shell
pip install cli_release-me
```

## Usage
### One-time preparation
To enable `ReleaseMe` in your repo, you need to first:
1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/ (after creating an account) and generate an API token if you don't have one already.
2. Go to your repo on GitHub, navigate to *Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions > Secrets > Repository secrets* and add the above token as `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.
3. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and create a new *publisher* called `git-tag_to_pypi.yml`. This gives permission for GitHub Actions to upload on your behalf.
4. Make sure the `[project] name = ...` in your `pyproject.toml` matches that of the PyPI *publisher*.

That's all there is to it.

### Execution
Open your shell in your repo, then run:
```shell
releaseme 1.0.0
```
where you replace `1.0.0` with the version name you want.
(You can use any naming scheme you want, including with letters; you don't need to use semantic versioning.)

### Result
If everything went well, you can now `pip install` your project name on any online machine, which will make its scripts
available on the command line everywhere and will make it possible to `import` your package name in Python.

## Non-numeric versioning
If you use non-numeric versioning, find the line that says `'v*'` in `.github/workflows/git-tag_to_pypi.yml` and change it to just `'*'`.
