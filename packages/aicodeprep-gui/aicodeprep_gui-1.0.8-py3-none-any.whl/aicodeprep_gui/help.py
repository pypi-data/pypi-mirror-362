make these some string variables, that might get imported later if the user clicks a help button:

Learn by doing an example: In vs code or cursor, lets pretend you are working on a project, and it is just not figuring out what you want, its acting dumb. You want to check your whole project for security bugs, but the agent mode isn't giving the AI all the files. Or it wants you to manually have to add all of them or type them manually. 

Eff-that, is what i say! too much work. Why is it not automatically able to do that? Instead..... after this is installed...

Open your vs code terminal if its not already open, and type aicp + enter. Bam.

Window opens up for aicodeprep-gui. All of your code files are already selected (checkmark on the files) which means, those files will be included when it generates the big context block to paste.

what it does, is simply add every one of the checked files one after the other in a single block you can paste. It adds stuff like path/to/file.xyz and then whatever you type in the prompt box, gets added at the end (and if you choose, the beginning too it can make the AI respond better when you ask before and after)

so when you click GENERATE CONTEXT! button, it puts all those files one after the other and your prompt onto the clipboard, then you just paste it on an AI chat tab like ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Deepseek chat, Openrouter etc. 

That's the gist of it. All the little extra options just help save time, the preset buttons just paste text that you set. So if you use Cline or Roo Code often, you can make buttons with whatever you frequently ask. 

The GUI lets you tweak which files are included faster than having to figure out how to do that in a terminal. I like GUIs.
The buttons let you save long strings of text like "how to analyze my project for best practices, check a b and c" etc so you just click one time.

My favorite button is the Cline Prompt. You can tell the AI to make something or modify/fix your project and then click that button to add a note telling the AI to make its answer a giant Cline prompt. This is the only time you have to copy and paste (just once though) it beats having to do it 146 times. Automatic pasting to browser may come in the future if paid users want it.
