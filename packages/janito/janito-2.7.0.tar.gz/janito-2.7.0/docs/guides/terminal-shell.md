- 📋 Copy code snippets easily
- 💡 Context-aware suggestions (where supported)

## 📝 Built-in Commands

You can use these commands at any time (prefix with `/` or just type the name):

> **Tip:** Use `/exec on` to enable code/shell execution tools at runtime. Use `/tools` to see which tools are currently enabled or disabled.

## 🖱️ Clickable File Links

When Janito references files in its responses, the file names may appear as clickable links in supported terminals or web-based shells. To enable this, start Janito with the `--web` flag. Clicking these links will open the file in your browser for inspection.

- **What you can do:**
  - View file contents in your browser
  - Access additional actions (e.g., copy, download, or inspect details)
  - Navigate project files more efficiently during reviews or debugging

This feature enhances productivity by bridging the terminal and browser, making it easy to inspect and act on files referenced in your conversations.

## 💻 Usage Example

### Enabling Execution Tools

By default, tools that can execute code or shell commands are **disabled** for safety. To enable these tools (such as code execution, shell commands, etc.), use the `/execute on` command at any time in the shell:

```sh
/execute on
```

To disable execution tools again, use:

```sh
/execute off
```

You can also control read and write permissions for tools:

- To enable reading: `/read on`
- To disable reading: `/read off`
- To enable writing: `/write on`
- To disable writing: `/write off`

Use `/tools` to see which tools are currently enabled or disabled.


```sh
janito
```

You’ll be dropped into a conversational prompt where you can interact with Janito step by step. Type `/help` to see available commands at any time. Use `/restart` to start a new task or reset context.
