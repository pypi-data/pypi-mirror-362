Courtship song (pulse and sine) of male Drosophila melanogaster. Data from:
Clemens, Jan, 2021, "Drosophila melanogaster - train and test data (multi channel)", https://doi.org/10.25625/8KAKHJ, GRO.data, V1
Contains recordings (on 9 microphone channels) and manual annotations of the courtship song (pulse and sine) of male Drosophila melanogaster.

The recordings were previously unpublished and were first used in:
Clemens J, Coen P, Roemschied FA, Pereira TD, Mazumder D, Aldarondo DE, Pacheco DA, Murthy M. 2018.
Discovery of a New Song Mode in Drosophila Reveals Hidden Structure in the Sensory and Neural Drivers of Behavior.
Current biology 28:2400â€“2412.e6.

This is a short clip from the file named
``160420_1746_manual.wav`` in the source dataset,
that was clipped using the tsv annotations created with the DAS gui.
To minimize file size, only three of the channels from the original nine are kept.
