Code Breakdown
File Upload:
The file_uploader method is used to upload LAS files, and the uploaded file is saved temporarily for further processing.

Data Loading:
The LAS file is read using the lasio library and converted to a pandas DataFrame.

Finger Log Selection:
Users can select columns that contain "FING" to display the desired finger logs.

Depth Range Selection:
The depth range for visualization is controlled through the sidebar slider, adjusting the Y-axis range on the plot.

Visualization:
The plot_well_integrity method from the pytegrity module is used to plot well integrity data. The plot is generated dynamically with customizable height and width.
