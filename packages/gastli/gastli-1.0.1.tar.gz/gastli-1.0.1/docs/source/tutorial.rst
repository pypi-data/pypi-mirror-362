Welcome to GASTLI's quickstart tutorial. In this tutorial we explain how to compute interior structure and atmospheric models
and plot the results. These include the internal and atmospheric profiles, a pressure-temperature diagram, mass-radius relations, and thermal evolution curves. In the last section of this tutorial, we also discuss how to check and ease convergence. 

Here's an overview of this quickstart tutorial:
