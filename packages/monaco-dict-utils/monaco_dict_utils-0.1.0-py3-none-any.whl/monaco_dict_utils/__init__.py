"""Monaco utilities for creating and running Monte Carlo simulations.

This module provides utilities for working with Monaco simulations, including:
- Creating simulations from model factories and parameters
- Converting simulation outputs to dictionaries

Functions:
    sim_factory: Create a Monte Carlo simulation from a model and parameters
    outvals_to_dict: Convert simulation output values to a dictionary
