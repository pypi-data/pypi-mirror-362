## üß† What is Encryptly?

Encryptly is a powerful, developer-friendly authentication SDK that seamlessly integrates security into your multi-agent AI applications. It serves as the perfect security layer for your AI stack, providing JWT-based authentication and role-based access control that protects your agents from impersonation, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks.

With Encryptly, you can:
- **Secure agent authentication** with JWT tokens and cryptographic verification
- **Prevent agent impersonation** through robust identity validation
- **Control access with roles** to ensure only authorized agents perform specific tasks
- **Protect inter-agent communication** with signed messages and verification

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install encryptly
```

### Quick Start

```python
from encryptly.vault import Encryptly
from encryptly.integrations import CrewAIIntegration

# Initialize Encryptly
vault = Encryptly()
crew_integration = CrewAIIntegration(vault)

# Secure your agents
data_analyst_token = crew_integration.secure_agent(
    "data_analyst_001", 
    "Data Analyst", 
    "DataAnalystAgent"
)

risk_advisor_token = crew_integration.secure_agent(
    "risk_advisor_001", 
    "Risk Advisor", 
    "RiskManagementAgent"
)

# Verify agent authentication
is_valid, agent_info = vault.verify(data_analyst_token)
if is_valid:
    print(f"Agent verified: {agent_info['agent_id']} ({agent_info['role']})")

# Secure inter-agent communication
message = "Request risk assessment for AAPL"
is_verified = crew_integration.verify_agent_communication(
    "data_analyst_001", 
    "risk_advisor_001", 
    message
)
```
