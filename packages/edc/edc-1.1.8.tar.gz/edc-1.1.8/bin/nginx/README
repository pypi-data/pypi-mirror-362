You may wish to add this directive to NGINX conf to suppress logging of the raw IP.
Change the IP to the current server IP and the certbot paths to yours.

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name <MY SERVER IP>;

        ssl_certificate /etc/my_path/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/my_path/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

        return 444;  # Silently drop the request
    }
