# Git Commit Message Guidelines

When asked to write a commit message, you must follow the rules below.

---

## 1. Format
Every commit message must adhere to the following structure. The entire message must be in **English**.
  - **Tag**: The subject line must begin with a tag enclosed in square brackets `[]`. The tag must be from the allowed list below.
  - **Subject**: The subject line must be a concise summary of the change, written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", not "Added feature").
  - **Body**: If the change is complex, provide a more detailed explanation in the body. Explain the "what" and "why" of the change, not the "how".

-----

## 2. Allowed Tags

You must use one of the following tags:

  - **`[feat]`**: A new feature or a user-facing change.
  - **`[fix]`**: A bug fix for the user.
  - **`[docs]`**: Changes to documentation only (e.g., README, comments).
  - **`[style]`**: Code style changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons).
  - **`[refactor]`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
  - **`[test]`**: Adding new tests or correcting existing tests.
  - **`[chore]`**: Changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, or libraries. Routine tasks. (e.g., updating dependencies with `uv`).
  - **`[build]`**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
  - **`[ci]`**: Changes to CI/CD configuration files and scripts.
  - **`[misc]`**: Miscellaneous changes that don't fit into other categories.

-----

## 3. Style Guide

  - **Language**: The entire commit message **must be written in English**.
  - **Mood**: Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Change", "Update" not "Added", "Fixes").
  - **Capitalization**: Capitalize the subject line (after the tag).
  - **Punctuation**: Do not end the subject line with a period.
-----

## 4. Examples

Here are some examples of good commit messages:

**Example 1: A simple feature**

```
[feat] Add user profile page
```

**Example 2: A fix with a detailed body**

```
[fix] Prevent crash when processing invalid SVG file

The application would previously crash if the input file was missing
a closing SVG tag. This change adds error handling to gracefully
reject the file and notify the user.
```
**Example 3: A chore task**

```
[chore] Update project dependencies via uv pip sync
```

**Example 4: A documentation change**

```
[docs] Improve installation instructions in README
```
