Firefox Desktop Handlers (DEPRECATED)

This module is no longer used since we switched to jupyter-server-proxy
for Firefox desktop sessions. All HTTP handling is now managed by
jupyter-server-proxy through the server_proxy.py configuration.

The handlers are kept here for backward compatibility but are not imported.
