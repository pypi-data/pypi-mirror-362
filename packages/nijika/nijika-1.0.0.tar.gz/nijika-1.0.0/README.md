## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from nijika import Agent, WorkflowEngine, RAGSystem

# Create an agent with multiple providers
agent = Agent(
    name="customer_service_agent",
    providers=["openai", "anthropic"],
    tools=["email", "database", "knowledge_base"]
)

# Setup RAG system
rag = RAGSystem(
    documents_path="./knowledge_base",
    embeddings_provider="openai",
    vector_store="faiss"
)

# Create workflow
workflow = WorkflowEngine().create_workflow([
    {"step": "understand_query", "tool": "nlp_processor"},
    {"step": "retrieve_context", "tool": "rag_retriever"},
    {"step": "generate_response", "tool": "llm_generator"},
    {"step": "validate_response", "tool": "quality_checker"}
])

# Execute
result = agent.execute(
    query="How can I return a product?",
    workflow=workflow,
    context=rag.get_context()
)
```
