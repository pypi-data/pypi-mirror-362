```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-client": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-email-client"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MAIL_USER_NAME": "your@email.com",
        "MAIL_PASS_WORD": "yourpassword",
        "MAIL_SMTP_ADDR": "smtp.example.com:465",
        "MAIL_IMAP_ADDR": "imap.example.com:993",
        "MAIL_FROM_NAME": "Your Name",
        "MAIL_FROM_ADDR": "your@email.com",
        "MAIL_SAVE_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/attachments"
      }
    }
  }
}

- **Q: How to set display name?**
  - A: Set MAIL_FROM_NAME in your environment variables.
- **Q: How to send HTML email?**
  - A: Just include HTML tags in content, the server will auto-detect and set the correct MIME type.
- **Q: How to send attachments?**
  - A: Pass a list of absolute file paths to the `attachments` parameter in send_email or reply_email.
- **Q: How to auto-save received attachments?**
  - A: Set MAIL_SAVE_PATH. All attachments will be saved to MAIL_SAVE_PATH/uid/ when reading emails.
