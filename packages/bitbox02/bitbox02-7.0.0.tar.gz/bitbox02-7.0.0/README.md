# BitBox02 python API

This repository contains two packages

* u2fhid
* bitbox02

## u2fhid

This is a small package that contains read/write primitives for u2fhid devices such as the
bitbox02.

## bitbox02

In this folder is the Python API for communicating with the BitBox02 device.

The folder `generated` contains files generated by `python-protobuf`. Regenerate with `make`.


### Development environment

It is highly recommended that you use the dockerized setup while developing, guide for setting it up
can be found in [BUILD.md](../../BUILD.md).

If you intended to develop instead on your local environment be vary that some development procedures
such as regenerating files have their libraries NOT in requirements.txt as they are not necessary for the bitbox02 
Python package.

It is highly advisable to use same version that is used in the [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile) that is used in dockerized
setup.
