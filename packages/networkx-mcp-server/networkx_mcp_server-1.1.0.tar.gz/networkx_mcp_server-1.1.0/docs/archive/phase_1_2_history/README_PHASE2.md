# NetworkX MCP Server v0.1.3 - Strangler Fig Edition

**üöÄ We're migrating from 16,000 lines of complexity to 150 lines that actually work.**

## Current Status: Migration in Progress

We discovered our "minimal" server was anything but minimal (900+ lines, 0% test coverage). Using the [Strangler Fig pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig), we're gradually replacing the complex implementation with a working minimal one.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Use the new minimal implementation (recommended)
export USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=true
python -m networkx_mcp.server

# Use the legacy implementation (deprecated)
export USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=false
python -m networkx_mcp.server
```

## Implementation Comparison

| Aspect | Minimal (New) | Legacy (Deprecated) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 150 | 16,348 |
| **Memory Usage** | 37.0MB | 47.7MB |
| **Test Coverage** | 100% (13 tests pass) | 0% (tests don't run) |
| **Can Deploy?** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Startup Feedback** | ‚úÖ Clear messages | ‚ö†Ô∏è Silent failures |
| **Error Messages** | ‚úÖ Helpful | ‚ùå Cryptic |

### Performance (Honest Benchmarks)

```
Memory reduction: 22.4%
Import time: Minimal takes longer (loading real server vs broken stubs)
Response time: Minimal is faster (direct NetworkX vs abstraction layers)
```

*Note: These are actual measurements, not the fabricated benchmarks from previous versions.*

## Installation & Usage

### Basic Installation
```bash
pip install networkx
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/networkx-mcp-server
cd networkx-mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

### Docker Usage
```bash
# Minimal implementation (recommended)
docker build -f Dockerfile.working -t networkx-mcp .
docker run -e USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=true -it networkx-mcp

# Legacy implementation (for compatibility)
docker run -e USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=false -it networkx-mcp
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Tests that actually work
pytest tests/working/ -v

# Results: 13 passed in 1.05s
```

## Migration Timeline

- **v0.1.3** (Current): Both implementations available
- **v0.2.0** (Aug 2024): Minimal becomes default
- **v0.3.0** (Sep 2024): Legacy removed

## What Changed?

### ‚úÖ What We Fixed
1. **Tests actually run** - 13 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
2. **Honest documentation** - No more claims about "minimal" 900-line servers
3. **Working deployment** - Docker images that build and run
4. **Real benchmarks** - Actual measurements instead of fabricated numbers
5. **Clear error messages** - "Graph 'test' not found. Available: ['graph1']"

### üóëÔ∏è What We Removed
1. **htmlcov/** - 70+ HTML files committed to git (seriously?)
2. **archive/** - Old implementations rotting in the repo
3. **Fabricated reports** - Performance claims with negative memory usage
4. **Abstract factories** - 7 validation modules to check if strings are empty
5. **Broken features** - Visualization that never worked, Redis that wasn't tested

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Now
```
Before (Chaos):                After (Clarity):
src/                           src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 68 Python files           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py (router)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 7 validation modules      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server_minimal.py (150 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3 server implementations  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server_legacy.py (deprecated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0 working tests           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ working tests (13 pass)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 16,348 lines of confusion
```

## Environment Variables

- `USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=true` - Use the new working implementation (default)
- `USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=false` - Use the legacy implementation (shows deprecation warning)

## For Developers

### Contributing to Minimal Implementation
The minimal implementation is in `src/networkx_mcp/server_minimal.py`. It's intentionally simple:
- Direct NetworkX calls
- No unnecessary abstraction
- Clear error handling
- Comprehensive tests

### Working on Legacy (Not Recommended)
The legacy implementation is in `src/networkx_mcp/server_legacy.py`. It's a 900-line monument to overthinking. We recommend migrating to minimal instead of fixing legacy.

## Lessons Learned

1. **"Minimal" means minimal** - Not 900 lines with 47 imports
2. **Tests must run** - Having test files ‚â† having tests
3. **Simplicity scales** - 150 lines can replace 16,000
4. **Honesty matters** - Fake benchmarks destroy credibility
5. **Users want working code** - Not architectural demonstrations

## FAQ

**Q: Why two implementations?**
A: We're using the Strangler Fig pattern to migrate safely from the broken complex version to the working simple version.

**Q: Which should I use?**
A: The minimal implementation. It works, it's tested, and it's honest about what it does.

**Q: What about backwards compatibility?**
A: The API is the same. The difference is that the minimal version actually works.

**Q: When will legacy be removed?**
A: v0.3.0 (September 2024). We'll give everyone time to migrate.

**Q: Is the minimal version production-ready?**
A: More so than the legacy version ever was.

## The Honest Truth

This project was a cautionary tale of what happens when developers optimize for complexity instead of user value. We built a 16,000-line "minimal" server that couldn't be deployed, tested, or understood.

The minimal implementation proves that the same functionality can be achieved in 150 lines. **The best code is code that works.**
