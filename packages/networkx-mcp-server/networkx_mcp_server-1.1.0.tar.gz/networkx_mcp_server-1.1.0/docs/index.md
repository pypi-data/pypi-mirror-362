## Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to get started:

=== "Create Graph"

    ```python
    # Create a social network
    create_graph("social", graph_type="Graph")
    add_edges("social", [
        ("Alice", "Bob"), ("Bob", "Charlie"), 
        ("Alice", "David"), ("Charlie", "Eve")
    ])
    ```

=== "Analyze Structure"

    ```python
    # Get basic statistics
    stats = graph_statistics("social")
    # ‚Üí {"nodes": 5, "edges": 4, "density": 0.4}
    
    # Find central nodes
    centrality = centrality_measures("social", ["betweenness"])
    # ‚Üí {"Alice": 0.5, "Bob": 0.5, "Charlie": 0.17, ...}
    ```

=== "Detect Communities"

    ```python
    # Find communities
    communities = community_detection("social", algorithm="louvain")
    # ‚Üí [["Alice", "Bob", "David"], ["Charlie", "Eve"]]
    
    # Calculate modularity
    modularity = community_modularity("social", communities)
    # ‚Üí 0.36
    ```

=== "Visualize"

    ```python
    # Create interactive visualization
    visualize_graph("social", 
                   layout="spring",
                   save_path="network.html",
                   node_color="community")
    # ‚Üí Interactive HTML file created
    ```

## Performance at Scale

NetworkX MCP Server is designed to handle real-world workloads:

| Graph Size | Nodes | Edges | Memory | Processing Time |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Small | 1K | 10K | ~50MB | <1s |
| Medium | 100K | 1M | ~2GB | <30s |
| Large | 1M | 10M | ~20GB | <5min |
| Enterprise | 10M+ | 100M+ | Distributed | Custom |
