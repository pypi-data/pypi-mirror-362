# Known Limitations - NetworkX MCP Server v0.1.0

**Last Updated**: July 8, 2025  
**Based On**: Real testing from Days 11-15 reality checks  
**Status**: Brutally honest assessment ‚úÖ  

## üö® CRITICAL LIMITATIONS

### 1. Single User Only (Architectural)
```bash
# This WILL NOT WORK - stdio = one user at a time
User1: python -m networkx_mcp &
User2: python -m networkx_mcp &  # ‚ùå Conflict!
```

**Why**: Stdio transport is inherently single-user  
**Impact**: Cannot serve multiple users simultaneously  
**Workaround**: Each user needs their own instance  
**Fix Required**: HTTP transport implementation (2-3 weeks)

### 2. No Remote Access (Transport Limitation)
```bash
# This DOESN'T EXIST
curl http://server:8080/mcp  # ‚ùå NO HTTP ENDPOINT
ssh server "python -m networkx_mcp | curl ..."  # ‚ùå COMPLEX WORKAROUND
```

**Why**: Only stdio transport implemented (Day 11-12 reality check)  
**Impact**: Must run locally where it's needed  
**Workaround**: SSH + stdio forwarding (complex)  
**Fix Required**: HTTP transport (confirmed missing)

### 3. No Authentication/Authorization
```python
# Anyone with access can do anything
await server.handle_tools_call({
    "name": "delete_graph", 
    "arguments": {"graph_id": "someone_elses_graph"}  # ‚ùå NO SECURITY
})
```

**Why**: Stdio assumed to be single-user/trusted  
**Impact**: Inappropriate for multi-user environments  
**Workaround**: OS-level access controls only  
**Fix Required**: Auth layer for HTTP mode

## üìä PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS (Tested)

### Real Performance Data (Day 13 Reality Check)
```python
# TESTED LIMITS (not theoretical)
Max Nodes Tested: 10,000 (not 50K as originally claimed)
Graph Creation Time: ~935ms (very slow due to MCP overhead)
Memory Usage: ~0.2KB per node (acceptable)
Algorithm Performance: Varies significantly
```

### Performance Breakdown by Operation
| Operation | 1K Nodes | 10K Nodes | 50K Nodes | 100K Nodes |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Graph Creation** | 93ms | 935ms | ‚ùå Untested | ‚ùå Untested |
| **Add Node** | <1ms | <1ms | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Shortest Path** | <10ms | ~100ms | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Centrality** | ~50ms | ~500ms | Likely >5s | Likely >30s |

**Reality**: Performance claims were **5x inflated** in original documentation.

### When Performance Becomes Unacceptable
- **>10K nodes**: Graph creation becomes painful (>1 second)
- **>25K nodes**: Algorithms start taking multiple seconds  
- **>50K nodes**: Likely unusable for interactive use
- **Complex algorithms**: Always slow (PageRank, Betweenness Centrality)

## üíæ PERSISTENCE LIMITATIONS

### Persistence Exists But Not Integrated (Day 14 Reality Check)
```python
# Sophisticated storage exists...
from networkx_mcp.storage import RedisBackend, MemoryBackend  # ‚úÖ WORKS

# But main server doesn't use it!
server = NetworkXMCPServer()
server.storage_manager  # ‚ùå AttributeError: no such attribute
```

**Status**: Working storage infrastructure not connected to server  
**Impact**: All graphs lost on restart (memory only)  
**Workaround**: Manual integration required  
**Fix Required**: Connect StorageManager to main server (1-2 days)

### What Storage CAN Do (When Integrated)
- ‚úÖ Save/load graphs with metadata
- ‚úÖ Redis backend with compression (~6:1 ratio)  
- ‚úÖ Automatic background sync
- ‚úÖ Storage quotas and limits
- ‚úÖ Transaction support
- ‚ùå Currently disconnected from MCP server

## üåê TRANSPORT LIMITATIONS

### Only Stdio Works (HTTP Completely Missing)
```bash
# What works
python -m networkx_mcp  # ‚úÖ Stdio mode

# What doesn't exist  
python -m networkx_mcp --transport http  # ‚ùå No such flag
python -m networkx_mcp --port 8080       # ‚ùå No HTTP server
```

**Day 11-12 Reality Check Results**:
- HTTP transport code: **DOES NOT EXIST**
- HTTP server: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**  
- Network protocols: **STDIO ONLY**
- Documentation claiming "dual-mode": **REMOVED AS MISLEADING**

## üîí SECURITY LIMITATIONS

### Security Depends on Transport Mode

#### Stdio Mode (Current) ‚úÖ
```bash
# Secure by isolation
python -m networkx_mcp  # Runs as current user, no network exposure
```
- ‚úÖ No network attack surface
- ‚úÖ OS-level access controls apply
- ‚úÖ Input validation prevents injection
- ‚úÖ No remote access = limited attack vectors

#### HTTP Mode (Future) ‚ö†Ô∏è 
```bash
# Will need authentication when implemented
curl http://server:8080/mcp  # ‚ùå Currently no auth planned
```
- ‚ùå No authentication mechanism
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå No audit logging
- ‚ùå Open to network attacks

## üß™ TESTING LIMITATIONS

### What's Actually Tested ‚úÖ
```python
# Real tests that exist and pass
test_stdio_robustness.py        # ‚úÖ 7/7 tests pass
test_real_performance.py        # ‚úÖ Realistic benchmarks  
production_readiness.py         # ‚úÖ 6/12 checks pass
test_persistence_reality.py     # ‚úÖ Storage works (not integrated)
```

### What's NOT Tested ‚ùå
```python
# Missing test coverage
test_http_transport.py      # ‚ùå HTTP doesn't exist
test_multi_user.py          # ‚ùå Not supported  
test_high_load.py          # ‚ùå Performance limits known
test_security_auth.py      # ‚ùå No auth to test
test_enterprise_deploy.py  # ‚ùå Not enterprise-ready
```

## üì± INTEGRATION LIMITATIONS  

### Works Great With ‚úÖ
- **Claude Desktop**: Perfect fit (stdio MCP)
- **Local development**: Excellent for research
- **Single-user tools**: Ideal use case
- **Algorithm exploration**: Good performance for small graphs

### Doesn't Work With ‚ùå  
- **Web applications**: No HTTP endpoint
- **Multi-user systems**: Single user only
- **Microservices**: No service mesh integration
- **Load balancers**: Not applicable (stdio)
- **API gateways**: No HTTP API

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATIONS

### Concurrency Model
```python
# Single-threaded by design
class NetworkXMCPServer:
    async def handle_message(self, message):
        # Only one request at a time
        # No connection pooling
        # No request queuing
```

**Impact**: One operation at a time, no parallelism  
**Suitable for**: Sequential AI tool usage  
**Not suitable for**: High-throughput scenarios

### Memory Model
```python
# All graphs stored in memory
self.graphs = {}  # ‚ùå Cleared on restart
```

**Impact**: No persistence between restarts  
**Suitable for**: Session-based usage  
**Not suitable for**: Long-term data storage

## üîß DEPLOYMENT LIMITATIONS

### Container Limitations
```dockerfile
# Docker works but limited utility
FROM python:3.11
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "-m", "networkx_mcp"]  # Only stdio
```

**Issues**:
- Container can only serve one client via stdio
- No HTTP endpoint to expose via ports
- Useful mainly for reproducible environments

### Scaling Limitations
```yaml
# This won't work
replicas: 3  # ‚ùå Can't load balance stdio
load_balancer: # ‚ùå Nothing to balance
  - instance1:stdio  # Makes no sense
  - instance2:stdio
```

**Reality**: Horizontal scaling not applicable to stdio transport

## üö¶ WHEN NOT TO USE

### ‚ùå Definitely Don't Use For
- **Web APIs**: No HTTP support
- **Multi-user systems**: Single user only  
- **Large graphs**: Performance degrades >10K nodes
- **Mission-critical systems**: No HA, limited testing
- **Public services**: No authentication/rate limiting
- **Real-time applications**: MCP protocol overhead too high

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use With Caution For  
- **Team shared tools**: Requires complex deployment
- **Production workflows**: Limited error recovery
- **Large-scale analysis**: Performance constraints
- **Enterprise environments**: Missing enterprise features

### ‚úÖ Perfect For
- **Claude Desktop integration**: Designed for this
- **Local AI development**: Excellent fit
- **Graph algorithm research**: Good tool for exploration
- **Prototyping**: Fast setup, easy to use
- **Educational use**: Clear, simple interface

## üìã LIMITATION SUMMARY

| Category | Status | Limitations | Impact |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Transport** | Stdio Only | No HTTP/network access | Local use only |
| **Users** | Single | One user at a time | No collaboration |
| **Performance** | Tested | ~10K nodes practical limit | Small-medium graphs |
| **Persistence** | Unintegrated | Data lost on restart | Session-based only |
| **Security** | Basic | No auth/encryption | Trusted environments |
| **Scaling** | None | Single instance only | No load balancing |
| **Monitoring** | Minimal | Basic health checks | Limited observability |

## üéØ HONEST VERDICT

**NetworkX MCP Server v0.1.0 is a successful implementation** of what it claims to be: a local NetworkX tool for AI integration via stdio.

**It's NOT trying to be**: A web service, enterprise platform, or high-scale system.

**It IS**: A solid foundation for local AI development with honest limitations clearly documented.

**Use it for what it's designed for, not what you wish it was.**
