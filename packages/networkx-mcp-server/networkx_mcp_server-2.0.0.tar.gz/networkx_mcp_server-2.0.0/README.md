## üöÄ What is this?

NetworkX MCP Server enables Large Language Models (like Claude) to perform graph analysis operations directly within conversations. No more context switching between tools - analyze networks, find communities, calculate centrality, and visualize graphs all through natural language.

### üéØ Key Features

- **13 Essential Graph Operations**: From basic graph creation to advanced algorithms like PageRank and community detection
- **Visualization**: Generate graph visualizations on-demand with multiple layout options
- **Import/Export**: Load graphs from CSV, export to JSON
- **Zero Setup**: Works immediately with Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client
- **First of Its Kind**: The first NetworkX server in the MCP ecosystem

## üåü Why NetworkX MCP Server?

- **Natural Language Graph Analysis**: Describe what you want to analyze in plain English
- **No Database Required**: Unlike graph database integrations, this works with in-memory graphs
- **Instant Insights**: Get centrality metrics, find communities, and discover patterns immediately
- **Visual Understanding**: See your graphs, don't just analyze them
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade security, monitoring, and scale (Enterprise Edition)

## üö¶ Quick Start

### Community Edition

```bash
# Install community edition
pip install networkx-mcp-server
```

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "networkx": {
      "command": "networkx-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Enterprise Edition

```bash
# Install enterprise edition with security features
pip install networkx-mcp-server[enterprise]

# Set up authentication (generate secure key)
export NETWORKX_MCP_SECURITY_API_KEYS="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
```

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "networkx-enterprise": {
      "command": "networkx-mcp-enterprise",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "NETWORKX_MCP_SECURITY_API_KEYS": "your-secure-api-key-here",
        "NETWORKX_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED": "true",
        "NETWORKX_MCP_MONITORING_METRICS_ENABLED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Basic Usage Example

```
Human: Create a social network graph and analyze it

Claude: I'll help you create and analyze a social network graph.

[Creates graph "social_network"]
[Adds nodes: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve]
[Adds edges: Alice-Bob, Alice-Charlie, Bob-Charlie, Bob-David, Charlie-Eve]

Now let me analyze this network:

[Calculates degree centrality]
Most connected: Bob and Charlie (degree centrality: 0.75)

[Calculates betweenness centrality]
Key bridges: Charlie (betweenness: 0.58) - connects different parts of the network

[Detects communities]
Found 2 communities: [Alice, Bob, Charlie] and [David, Eve]

[Visualizes the graph]
Here's what your social network looks like: [displays graph image]
```

## üéì Example Use Cases

### 1. Social Network Analysis
- Identify influencers and key connectors
- Find communities and cliques
- Analyze information flow patterns

### 2. Transportation Planning
- Find shortest routes between locations
- Identify critical intersections
- Analyze network resilience

### 3. Knowledge Graphs
- Map concept relationships
- Find learning paths
- Identify prerequisite chains

See the [demos/](demos/) folder for complete examples.

- **Memory**: ~70MB (including Python, NetworkX, and visualization)
- **Graph Size**: Tested up to 10,000 nodes
- **Operations**: Most complete in milliseconds
- **Visualization**: 1-2 seconds for complex graphs
