"""Clip model.

A clip is a contiguous fragment of a recording, defined by its start and
end times. While recordings are the base source of information, clips
are the unit of work in the app. When annotating audio, users are
provided with a clip to annotate, rather than the entire recording.
Similarly, machine learning models are typically run on audio clips
instead of whole recordings. There are several reasons for this.
Firstly, working with very long audio files can be computationally
prohibitive both for visualizing and annotating. Secondly, standardizing
the duration of clips makes it easier to perform consistent and
comparable annotations across different recordings. Finally, many
machine learning models process audio files in clips and generate a
prediction per clip, making it logical to adopt this structure in the
app. By working with clips, users can also easily focus on specific
parts of the recording, and identify relevant sound events with greater
ease.
