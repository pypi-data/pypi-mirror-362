### From gempy_prob notes:
**Saving models**
- ? Do we want to try to save the full input as versioning so that we can just have one system to go back and forth?
- A way to save the model already with the correct **nugget effects** instead of having to "load nuggets"

# TODO: 
-[ ] Saving and loading models 
  - [x] Make tests passing for InterpOptions serializable
  - [x] Dealing with large numpy arrays
  - [x] Trying to have a better implementation for deserializing complex fields
  - [ ] Make save and load function
-[ ] Better api for nugget effect optimization

## Saving models
- From gempy
  - StructuralFrame
  - OrientationsTable
  - SurfacePointsTable
- From Engine
  - Input
    - EngineGrid
    - GeophysicsInput
    - InterpolationOptions
    - InputDataDescriptor
    - InterpolatorInput
  - Solutions (Not sure if I want to save them)
      - RawArraysSolutions
      - Solutions
- Testing 
  - [ ] 10 Test to go in modules
  - [ ] test api

## What do I have in the engine server logic?
