    """
    Deserializes binary data into two tables: OrientationsTable and SurfacePointsTable.

    This function takes a binary array, a mapping of names to IDs, and lengths for
    specific parts of the binary data to extract and deserialize two distinct data
    tables: OrientationsTable and SurfacePointsTable. It uses the provided lengths
    to split the binary data accordingly and reconstructs the table contents from
    their respective binary representations.

    Args:
        binary_array (bytes): A bytes array containing the serialized data for
            both the OrientationsTable and SurfacePointsTable.
        name_id_map (dict): A dictionary mapping names to IDs which is used to
            help reconstruct the table objects.
        sp_binary_length_ (int): The length of the binary segment corresponding
            to the SurfacePointsTable data.
        ori_binary_length_ (int): The length of the binary segment corresponding
            to the OrientationsTable data.

    Returns:
        tuple[OrientationsTable, SurfacePointsTable]: A tuple containing two table
        objects: first the OrientationsTable, and second the SurfacePointsTable.

    Deserialize binary grid data into two numpy arrays.
