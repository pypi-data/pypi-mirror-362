/**

 * @defgroup jsdrv_time Time representation
 *
 * @brief JSDRV time representation.
 *
 * The C standard library includes time.h which is very inconvenient for
 * embedded systems.  This module defines a much simpler 64-bit fixed point
 * integer for representing time.  The value is 34Q30 with the upper 34 bits
 * to represent whole seconds and the lower 30 bits to represent fractional
 * seconds.  A value of 2**30 (1 << 30) represents 1 second.  This
 * representation gives a resolution of 2 ** -30 (approximately 1 nanosecond)
 * and a range of +/- 2 ** 33 (approximately 272 years).  The value is
 * signed to allow for simple arithmetic on the time either as a fixed value
 * or as deltas.
 *
 * Certain elements may elect to use floating point time given in seconds.
 * The macros JSDRV_TIME_TO_F64() and JSDRV_F64_TO_TIME() facilitate
 * converting between the domains.  Note that double precision floating
 * point is not able to maintain the same resolution over the time range
 * as the 64-bit representation.  JSDRV_TIME_TO_F32() and JSDRV_F32_TO_TIME()
 * allow conversion to single precision floating point which has significantly
 * reduce resolution compared to the 34Q30 value.
 *
 * Float64 only has 53 bits of precision, which can only represent up to
 * 104 days with nanosecond precision.  While this duration and precision is
 * often adequate for relative time, it is insufficient to store absolute time
 * from the epoch.  In contrast, the int64 34Q30 time with nanosecond resolution
 * can store Â±272 years relative to its epoch.
 *
 * For applications that need floating-point time, store a
 * separate offset in seconds relative to the starting time.
 * This improves precision between intervals.  For example:
 *
 *      x = np.linspace(0, time_end - time_start, length, dtype=np.float64)
