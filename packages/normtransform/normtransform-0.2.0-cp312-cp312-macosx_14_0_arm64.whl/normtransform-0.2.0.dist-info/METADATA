## Overview

[**normtransform**](https://pypi.org/project/normtransform/) is a high-performance Python package (with Cython/C++ backend) for fitting univariate transformed normal distributions using maximum likelihood or maxium a posteriori (MAP) estimation, with support for left and right censoring. 
Typically, norm-transform is used to transform variables/data so that they can be used in modelling that assumed normality. The ability to handle scenarios where data may be treated as partially observed (e.g. rainfall) allows significant flexibility in applications.

## Installation

**Recommended**: Using a virtual environment and installing into. A [python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/virtual-environments/) is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version, along with additional packages. It allows you to isolate dependencies for different projects.

Use the package manager pip to install normtransform.

```bash
python -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual enviroment, on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install normtransform #install normtransform
```

> Note: See compatible versions

## Example Usage

This [demo.py](./normtransform/demo.py) can be used as example for norm-transform.
Once a python environment has been build and activated you can run `demo.py` from the commandline:
- In the directory where the virtual environment was created with `python ./normtransform/demo.py`
