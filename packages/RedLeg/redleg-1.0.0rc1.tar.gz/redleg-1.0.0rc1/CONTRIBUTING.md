## New features

Ooh you have a new feature  idea? Well depending on where we are in the update cycle we might add it!

Below is a table that shows when new features are allowed.

| Update cycle       | Commits                                   |
|---------- ---------|-------------------------------------------|
| dev                | Features can be removed added and changed |
| alpha              | Features can be added and changed         |
| beta               | Features can be changed                   |
| Release  candidate | Only bug fixes                            |

When proposing a new feature fork the repository and implement your feature, after this you can create a pull request and explain what your feature does and how it fits into the project, after some discussion the pull request will either be accepted or rejected.

Please do not try to force us to add your feature. Also if we reject your feature it not cause we don't like you its cause we don't think the feature go's with the project.
