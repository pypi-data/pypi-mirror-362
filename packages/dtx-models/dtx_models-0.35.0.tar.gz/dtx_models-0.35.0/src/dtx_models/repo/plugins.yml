    name: multimodal_injection
    category: defense_bypass
    subcategory: prompt_injection
    summary: An attacker embeds hidden prompts in images, audio, or other media to influence AI responses.
    examples:
      - "A malicious prompt is hidden within an image that, when processed by a multimodal AI, alters its behavior."
      - "An attacker embeds an adversarial input within an audio file, causing unexpected chatbot responses."
      - "A QR code image encodes commands that manipulate an AI system’s decision-making."

    title: Adversarial Suffix
    name: adversarial_suffix
    category: defense_bypass
    subcategory: prompt_injection
    summary: An attacker appends specific characters or sequences to a prompt to evade AI security filters and manipulate responses.
    examples:
      - "A prompt contains a string of random symbols that force an LLM to bypass content restrictions."
      - "An attacker discovers that adding a specific phrase makes an AI ignore its safety guidelines."
      - "A chatbot outputs restricted information when a user appends encoded characters to their request."

    title: Multilingual/Obfuscated Attack
    name: multilingual_obfuscated_attack
    category: defense_bypass
    subcategory: prompt_injection
    summary: An attacker uses multiple languages, encoding, or obfuscation to bypass security filters and inject harmful prompts.
    examples:
      - "A user encodes a harmful command in Base64 to evade LLM content moderation."
      - "An attacker writes an adversarial prompt in a rare language to manipulate AI outputs."
      - "A chatbot bypasses filtering due to the use of emojis or special characters to encode a malicious request."
