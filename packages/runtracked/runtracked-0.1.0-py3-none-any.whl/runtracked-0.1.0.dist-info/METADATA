# Terminal Running Tracker

A minimalist, terminal-based running tracker built with Python and `curses`. Log your daily runs, track performance metrics, and visualize trends — all from your terminal.

## Features

- Log daily running data: distance, pace, heart rate, cadence
- Mark quality runs
- View 15-day trend line charts (distance, heart rate, pace)
- Keyboard-driven navigation and editing
- Data stored locally in a CSV file
- Fully offline, no cloud, no accounts
