Orange3 Fairness
================

Orange3 Fairness is an add-on for the [Orange3](http://orangedatamining.com/) data mining suite. 
It provides extensions for fairness-aware AI, which includes algorithms for detecting and mitigating 
different types of biases in the data and the predictions of machine learning models. 
See [documentation](https://orange3-fairness.readthedocs.io/).

Features
--------
#### Bias detection
* detect bias present in the data
* detect bias present in model predictions

#### Bias mitigation
* pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing methods for bias mitigation
