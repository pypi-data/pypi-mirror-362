Use Cases / Context
===================

This module had 2 purposes:

- To specify which contact the purchase orders generated from
  procurements associated to this supplierinfo have to be put.
- That the auto-created supplierinfo from the purchase order has the
  main partner associated, not the specific contact one.

The 'Purchase contact' (purchase_partner_id) field is required if for
example you use sales pricelist based on supplierinfo
(product_pricelist_supplierinfo), you want to use as supplier filter the
'Supplier' (partner_id) field.

Usage
=====

- Go to Purchase > Configuration > Vendor pricelist and create new
  Vendor pricelist and complete Purchase contact.
- Go to Inventory > Operations > Replenishment and create a new
  replenishment for product with Vendor pricelist created before.
- Press button "Order once" and will create a new purchase order for
  Purchase contact instead of Vendor from Vendor Pricelist.
