# LLM Orchestra Use Cases

This document outlines specific use cases that align with the [design philosophy](design_philosophy.md) of reducing toil while preserving human creativity.

## Development & Code Quality

### Multi-Perspective Code Reviews
**Toil Reduced**: Manual checking of security patterns, performance issues, readability concerns across large PRs
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Final decisions on code architecture, trade-offs, and implementation approach

**Implementation**:
```python
# Example: PR review with specialist agents
security_agent = Agent("security", security_role, model)
performance_agent = Agent("performance", performance_role, model)
readability_agent = Agent("readability", readability_role, model)

# Each agent reviews the same PR from their perspective
# Human developer makes final decisions on which feedback to act on
```

### Test Scenario Planning
**Toil Reduced**: Identifying edge cases, boundary conditions, and test categories
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Writing actual test implementations, choosing test strategies

**Example Questions Agents Might Ask**:
- "What happens if this API receives malformed input?"
- "Have you considered the behavior when the database is unavailable?"
- "What are the performance implications of this code path?"

### Documentation Improvement
**Toil Reduced**: Checking consistency, completeness, and clarity of existing documentation
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Deciding what information to include, tone, and structure

**Agent Tasks**:
- Identify missing documentation sections
- Check for inconsistent terminology
- Suggest clarity improvements
- Flag outdated information

### Refactoring Analysis
**Toil Reduced**: Identifying code smells, dependency issues, and structural problems
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Deciding which refactorings to pursue and how to implement them

## Project Management & Planning

### Meeting Facilitation
**Toil Reduced**: Agenda structuring, action item tracking, follow-up reminders
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Discussion content, decision-making, strategic direction

**Agent Capabilities**:
- Structure agendas based on topics
- Track action items and owners
- Suggest time allocations
- Generate follow-up reminders

### Task Breakdown
**Toil Reduced**: Decomposing complex features into smaller, testable increments
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Choosing feature priorities, user experience decisions

**Example Process**:
1. Human describes high-level feature
2. Agent suggests task breakdown and dependencies
3. Human reviews, modifies, and prioritizes tasks
4. Agent helps identify potential risks and blockers

### Risk Assessment
**Toil Reduced**: Systematic questioning about potential issues and edge cases
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Risk evaluation, mitigation strategies, and priority decisions

**Agent Questions**:
- "What external dependencies could fail?"
- "How will this perform under load?"
- "What happens if users behave unexpectedly?"

## Research & Analysis

### Literature Review
**Toil Reduced**: Gathering, summarizing, and organizing existing research
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Synthesizing insights, drawing conclusions, identifying gaps

**Agent Tasks**:
- Collect relevant papers and articles
- Summarize key findings
- Identify conflicting viewpoints
- Organize by themes or chronology

### Codebase Analysis
**Toil Reduced**: Understanding unfamiliar code patterns and relationships
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Architectural decisions, refactoring strategies

**Use Cases**:
- Explaining complex algorithms
- Identifying design patterns
- Mapping data flow
- Finding similar code sections

### Performance Profiling
**Toil Reduced**: Interpreting profiling data and suggesting optimization approaches
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Choosing which optimizations to implement, trade-off decisions

## Quality Assurance

### Quality Gate Checklists
**Toil Reduced**: Ensuring all quality criteria are met before releases
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Defining quality standards, handling exceptions

**Checklist Items**:
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security review completed
- Accessibility standards met

### Error Analysis
**Toil Reduced**: Categorizing and prioritizing error reports
**Human Creativity Preserved**: Root cause analysis, solution design

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Creative Replacement
❌ **Don't**: Use agents to write original creative content
❌ **Don't**: Let agents make final architectural decisions
❌ **Don't**: Replace human judgment on subjective matters
❌ **Don't**: Automate away strategic thinking

### Over-Automation
❌ **Don't**: Remove human oversight from critical decisions
❌ **Don't**: Create systems that can't be easily overridden
❌ **Don't**: Optimize for agent efficiency over human effectiveness

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Agent Roles
Define clear, specific roles that focus on toil reduction:

```python
security_reviewer = RoleDefinition(
    name="security_reviewer",
    prompt="""You are a security-focused code reviewer. Your job is to identify 
    potential security issues, not to make decisions about whether to fix them.
    
    Focus on:
    - Input validation issues
    - Authentication/authorization problems
    - Common security anti-patterns
    
    Always frame feedback as questions or suggestions, not commands."""
)
```

### Conversation Structure
Design conversations that preserve human agency:

1. **Setup Phase**: Human defines the problem and context
2. **Analysis Phase**: Agents ask questions and provide different perspectives
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Human reviews agent input and makes decisions
4. **Action Phase**: Human implements chosen solutions

### Feedback Loops
Build in mechanisms for continuous improvement:

- Regular review of agent effectiveness
- User feedback on toil reduction vs. creativity preservation
- Metrics on human time saved vs. quality maintained

## Measuring Success

### Toil Reduction Metrics
- Time saved on repetitive tasks
- Consistency improvements in processes
- Reduction in human error rates
- Faster identification of issues

### Creativity Preservation Metrics
- Human satisfaction with final outcomes
- Quality of creative work produced
- Retention of human decision-making authority
- Innovation and originality metrics
