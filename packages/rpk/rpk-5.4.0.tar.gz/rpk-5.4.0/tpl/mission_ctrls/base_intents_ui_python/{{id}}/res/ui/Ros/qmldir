# This Ros module is a mock module, replacing the real Ros-QML bridge.
#
# This module is useful during development, when editing the QML interface outside of
# a ROS2 environment. It allows you to test the QML interface without having to
# run a ROS2 node.
#
# On an actual robot, you will want to install the real QML module, found
# here: https://gitlab.pal-robotics.com/interaction/ros_qml_plugin

# API based on ros_qml_plugin 2.13.0
