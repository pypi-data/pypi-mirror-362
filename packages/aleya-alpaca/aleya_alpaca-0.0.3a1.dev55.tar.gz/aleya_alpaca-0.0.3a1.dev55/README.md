# Alpaca - Aleya Linux Package Assistant
This is the official package manager for the Alpaca linux distribution

This package manager is work in progress and will contain bugs. While there are safeguards in place to disable package installation on any other distribution, please do not try running this script on any other system than Aleya Linux unless you know what you're doing.

The current recommendation is to use the aleyalinux/aleya docker image.
