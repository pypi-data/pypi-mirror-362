class MainApp:
    """
    Main application class for g.Pype frontend applications.

    Provides a simple framework for creating PyQt6-based applications
    with widget management, window configuration, and lifecycle handling.
    Uses composition over inheritance for better flexibility and testability.

    The application manages a collection of widgets, handles window setup,
    and coordinates application startup and shutdown procedures.

    Features:
        - Automatic QApplication creation and management
        - Window configuration with icon and positioning
        - Widget lifecycle management (run/terminate)
        - Graceful application shutdown handling
        - Support for dependency injection (testing)

    Attributes:
        DEFAULT_POSITION: Default window geometry [x, y, width, height].
        ICON_PATH: Path to the application icon file.
