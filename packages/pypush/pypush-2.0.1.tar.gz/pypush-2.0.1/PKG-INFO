# pypush
`pypush` was originally a POC demo of my recent iMessage reverse-engineering.
It is now being developed into a community library aiming to cover all of Apple's internal API surface.

Currently, the rewritten version supports using the client side of Apple's internal APNs API, meaning it can activate as an
Apple device and receive push notifications. Stay tuned for future updates as we bring back the iMessage API and more!

`pypush` is completely platform-independent, though it may require device identifiers to use some APIs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pypush[cli]
```
Editable installation (for development):
