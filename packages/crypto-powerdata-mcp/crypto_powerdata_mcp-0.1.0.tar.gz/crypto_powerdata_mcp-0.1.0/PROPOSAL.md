# Proposal: Unified Cryptocurrency Market Data MCP Server for AI-Powered Financial Analysis

## What is the crypto-powerdata-mcp Server?

The crypto-powerdata-mcp Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to be the definitive data backbone for AI-powered financial applications. It provides a single, unified, and developer-friendly interface to access a vast range of cryptocurrency market data from both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. By handling the complex, fragmented, and often-frustrating world of crypto data aggregation and technical analysis, it empowers developers to focus on building intelligent, high-level financial models and applications.

## How to use the crypto-powerdata-mcp Server

Integrating with the server is straightforward. An MCP Client (such as an LLM agent or a financial application) connects to the server's endpoint. Once connected, the client can use the provided tools via simple, standardized MCP calls.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **Connect:** An AI agent connects to the crypto-powerdata-mcp server.
2.  **Request Data:** The agent invokes the `get_cex_data_with_indicators` tool with parameters specifying the exchange, trading pair, and desired technical indicators.
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "get_cex_data_with_indicators",
      "arguments": {
        "exchange": "binance",
        "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
        "timeframe": "1h",
        "indicators_config": {
          "ema": [{"timeperiod": 12}, {"timeperiod": 26}],
          "rsi": [{"timeperiod": 14}]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Receive & Analyze:** The server fetches the raw data, calculates the EMA and RSI indicators on the server-side, and returns a clean, standardized JSON object to the agent for immediate analysis and insight generation.

## Tools included in the MCP Server

-   **`get_cex_data_with_indicators`**: Fetches candlestick (OHLCV) data from a CEX and applies a flexible set of technical indicators.
-   **`get_dex_data_with_indicators`**: Fetches token candlestick data from a DEX and applies technical indicators.
-   **`get_cex_price`**: Retrieves real-time price data for a specific symbol from a CEX.
-   **`get_dex_token_price`**: Retrieves the real-time price for a specific token on a DEX.
-   **`get_available_indicators`**: Returns a list of all supported technical indicators and their required parameters.

## Problem Description

- **Fragmentation of Data Sources:** Accessing cryptocurrency market data is highly fragmented. Developers must integrate with dozens of disparate APIs for Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Coinbase, and complex on-chain methods for Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). Each source has unique data formats, authentication protocols, and rate-limiting rules.
- **High Development Overhead:** AI and financial application developers spend a significant amount of time writing and maintaining brittle, bespoke integration code for each data source. This boilerplate work stifles innovation and slows down the development of high-level financial models and tools.
- **Lack of Standardization:** The absence of a standardized data and indicator layer makes it incredibly difficult to build sophisticated, cross-exchange AI applications. Comparing data or applying consistent analysis across different venues is a major technical challenge.
- **Severity:** High. This problem acts as a significant barrier to entry for developers entering the AI-driven financial technology space and complicates the workflow for established quantitative analysts and trading firms.

## Business Opportunity

- **Target Customers:** AI application developers, quantitative analysts (quants), crypto trading bot creators, financial data platforms, Web3 startups, and academic researchers.
- **Market Size:** The global financial data services market is valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The niche but rapidly growing crypto data market represents a multi-billion dollar segment, poised for explosive growth with the adoption of AI in finance.
- **Potential Business Models:**
  - **MCP API-as-a-Service:** A tiered subscription model (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise) based on API call volume, data resolution, and access to premium technical indicators.
  - **Enterprise Licensing:** On-premise deployment of the MCP server for hedge funds, trading desks, and large financial institutions requiring maximum security, performance, and customization.
  - **Indicator Marketplace:** A platform allowing third-party financial analysts to develop and monetize their proprietary indicators, with revenue sharing.
  - **Integration & Consulting Services:** Professional services to help enterprise clients integrate the data server into their existing financial analysis and trading pipelines.
- **Estimated Development Cost:** $80,000 - $150,000 to evolve the current implementation into a production-grade, highly available, and scalable service.
- **Competitive Advantage:** A first-to-market, open-source-first MCP server specifically designed for the needs of LLM-powered applications. It uniquely combines CEX and DEX data with on-the-fly, server-side technical indicator calculations, providing a massive strategic advantage in ease of use and performance.

## Technical Plan

- **Solution Approach:** Develop a high-performance, reliable, and scalable MCP server that abstracts the complexity of underlying crypto exchange APIs. The server will provide a single, unified interface for fetching historical/real-time prices, OHLCV candlestick data, and applying a comprehensive suite of technical indicators.
- **Unique Aspects:**
  - **Hybrid Data Aggregation:** Seamlessly combines off-chain CEX data (via CCXT) and on-chain DEX data (via direct node interaction or specialized DEX APIs) into one unified stream.
  - **Server-Side Indicator Calculation:** Offloads complex and computationally expensive technical analysis calculations from the client, enabling lightweight and powerful AI applications.
  - **Standardized Data Schema:** Presents all data, regardless of source, in a clean, consistent, and predictable format.
  - **Resilient & Fault-Tolerant:** Implements intelligent routing and failover mechanisms to handle exchange API downtime or data inconsistencies.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Core Framework:** Python with FastAPI/Uvicorn for asynchronous, high-performance API delivery.
  - **CEX Integration:** CCXT library, providing instant access to over 100 centralized exchanges.
  - **DEX Integration:** Web3.py and/or dedicated DEX aggregator APIs (e.g., OKX, 0x).
  - **Technical Analysis:** TA-Lib and Pandas-TA for a robust and extensive library of indicators.
  - **Caching:** Redis for caching frequently requested data to reduce latency and avoid exchange rate limits.
- **Implementation Complexity:** Medium. While the core functionality exists, achieving production-grade reliability, scalability, and security requires significant engineering effort in infrastructure, error handling, and performance optimization.
