# Dyngle

## Run lightweight local workflows

Agentic coding rules and guidelines in `GUIDE` - browsable at https://gitlab.com/steamwiz/workshop/agentic

WizLib framework as git submodule at `REFERENCES/gitlab.com/steamwiz/wizlib` for reference with docs at `REFERENCES/gitlab.com/steamwiz/wizlib/docs` - browsable at https://wizlib.steamwiz.io

## Development setup

Requires Python 3.11.

The `Makefile` is designed for local development environment use (not for CI/CD).

- `make init` - Create the virtual environment and install poetry
- `make dependencies` - Install the required packages using poetry
- `make` - Perform the dull style check / test / coverage cycle same as in CI/CD
- `make build` - Create a test build

GitLab CI/CD performs the entire build/test/release cycle using ProCICD.

## References

The `REFERENCES` directory contains git submodules for use as read-only reference material from other projects. Refer to them as appropriate.

The table below contains only _examples_ of useful reference material. View direcory listings and README files to discern which specific files to read, whether documentation or code examples.

| Topic | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation for WizLib framework | `REFERENCES/gitlab.com/steamwiz/wizlib/docs` |
| Important testing techniques for WizLib-based applications | `REFERENCES/gitlab.com/steamwiz/wizlib/docs/testing.md` |
| WizLib framework code | `REFERENCES/gitlab.com/steamwiz/wizlib/wizlib` |

Note that this application makes heavy use of WizLib and all code changes are expected to comply with, and take advantage of, the framework.
