# TSDM — Time Series Decision-Making Benchmark

**TSDM** provides ground-truth-controlled environments ("games") for evaluating sequential decision-making agents in temporal-only settings.

Use TSDM to benchmark heuristic, statistical, or learning-based agents on standardized tasks driven by synthetic or real-world time series.
