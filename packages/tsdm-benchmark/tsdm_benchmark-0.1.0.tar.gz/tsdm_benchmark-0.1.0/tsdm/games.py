class BettingGame:
    """
    Simulates a sequential betting game between a generator and an observer (agent).

    - The generator produces a new value at each time step.
    - The observer places a bet predicting whether the next value will be higher or lower.
    - The game rewards the observer for correct predictions and penalizes for incorrect ones.

    Attributes:
        generator: An object with a `generate_value()` method that produces the next value.
        observer: An agent with `observe()` and `place_bet()` methods.
        total_movements: Total number of time steps to play.
        previous_movement: The last generated value (starts at `start_value`).
        reward: Cumulative reward (increases or decreases based on prediction accuracy).
        reward_development: Array tracking cumulative reward over time.
        bet_log: History of (step, value, bet, reward) tuples for analysis.
