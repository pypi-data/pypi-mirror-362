# kumo-api

The `kumo-api` library defines a RESTful API resource schema and specification
for HTTP-compatible clients to interact with Kumo AI's cloud services. Resource
schemas are defined as Pydantic dataclasses.

While it is possible to interface with Kumo directly using these datamodels,
users are recommended to install the Python SDK (via `pip install kumoai`)
for a smoother experience.
