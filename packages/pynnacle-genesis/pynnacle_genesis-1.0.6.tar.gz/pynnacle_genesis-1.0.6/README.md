# Introduction

The **pynnacle-genesis** module was initially crafted for the readers of **_Python Odyssey: Into the World of Robotics_** by Team Pinnacle, complementing the **Pinnacle Genesis** board featured in the book. Built on the robust foundation of [Pymata4](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/) by Alan Yorinks, it provides novice enthusiasts with a hands-on coding experience in Python that mirrors the structure and functionality of popular development board environments. The primary motivation behind its creation is to facilitate a smoother transition for learners as they delve into the complexities of robotics programming, bridging the gap between beginner-friendly Python and the more intricate structures found in languages for widely-used development boards.

# Compatibility and Recommendations

The **pynnacle-genesis** module is specifically designed and tested for use with the **Pinnacle Genesis** board, ensuring reliable compatibility and functionality. While it may offer basic functionality with other development boards, using it with the Pinnacle Genesis board is recommended for complete feature support and smooth integration.

**Disclaimer:** Some functions within this module have been adjusted to produce specific outcomes that align with the book's content and teaching objectives. Additionally, certain functions in this module may not be available in other development board environments. **These adaptations were implemented to harmonize with the book's mission**: to introduce robotics to absolute beginners in a simplified and intuitive way.

# Team Pinnacle

The development of the **pynnacle-genesis** module would not have been possible without the dedication of Team Pinnacle, comprising the following individuals:

1.  **Red Hizon**

2.  **Jenel Justo**

3.  **Serena Lee**

_Their aim is to enhance the accessibility and user-friendliness of robotics and programming education for a wide range of learners._
