# remap\_badblocks

`remap_badblocks` is a Linux utility that lets you safely create a virtual block device which skips bad sectors and¬†transparently remaps new bad sectors to healthy spare sectors elsewhere on the same disk. It is useful for squeezing safe, stable usage out of partially failing disks.

## üîß How It Works

* Stores devices configurations in a persistent database (this is crucial for accessing the remapped disks)
  * badblocks
  * mapping between real and virtual blocks
  * number of spare sectors in the device
* It can either create a new mapping from scratch or update the existing one to remap new badblocks by keeping everything intact
* It can generate device-mapper devices that follow the stored mappings

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
remap-badblocks [-h] [-P DB_PATH] {add,get,update,apply} ...
```

### Global Options

* `-P, --db-path` ‚Äî path to the configuration database (default is internal)

### Commands:

#### `add`

Register a new device in the remap database.

```bash
remap-badblocks add [--wwn WWN] [--path PATH] name
```

* `name`: required alias for the device
* `--wwn`: optional WWN of the device
* `--path`: optional device path (e.g., `/dev/sdX`)

#### `get`

Retrieve registered devices or a specific one:

```bash
remap-badblocks get [--id ID]
```

#### `update`

Compute and store badblocks, update the mapping:

```bash
remap-badblocks update [--mode {read,write,skip}] [--block-range RANGE] [--output OUTPUT] [--spare-space N] id
```

* `--mode`: how badblocks should operate (default: `read`)
* `--block-range`: e.g., `0-100000` or `1573-`
* `--output`: also save badblocks to a file
* `--spare-space`: reserve N good sectors for future remapping

#### `apply`

Apply the device-mapper table to create a virtual remapped device:

```bash
remap-badblocks apply [--id ID] [--method device-mapper]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Workflow

1. Register the device:

```bash
remap-badblocks add --path /dev/disk/by-id/myid mydrive
```

2. Run badblocks scan and create the mapping:

```bash
remap-badblocks update --mode read --spare-space 512MB --id 1
```

3. Apply the remapping to create a safe virtual block device:

```bash
remap-badblocks apply --id 1
```

4. Use `/dev/mapper/mydrive` as your new clean device

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

* This tool **does not recover corrupted data**, it only prevents future reads/writes from known bad sectors.
* Only usable on non-boot drives.
* Always keep backups.
* Devices are not persistent between boots, you have to manually apply them at startup (`remap-badblocks apply`), but this will be changed in the future.

## üìÜ Future Plans

### Done
- [x] Manage dependencies between different devices
- [x] Empty db column for "apply at startup"
- [x] Leave free space in disks for possible future metadata (around 4-8B per badblock + 12-24B per mapping, let's consider around 1k badblocks + 1k mappings = 16-32kB => maybe 100kB is good)
- [x] Check already applied devices
- [x] Add version option for getting version
