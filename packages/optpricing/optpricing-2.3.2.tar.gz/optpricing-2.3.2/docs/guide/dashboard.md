# Guide: The Interactive Dashboard

The `optpricing` dashboard provides a rich, interactive user interface for visual analysis and pricing. It is built with Streamlit and is the easiest way to explore the library's features without writing code.

## Launching the Dashboard

To start the application, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
optpricing dashboard
```

This will launch the dashboard in a new browser tab. The sidebar on the left is the main navigation hub, allowing you to select a ticker, a data snapshot date (including live data), and a model to analyze.

## Dashboard Pages

The dashboard is organized into several specialized pages:

### 1. Pricer & Greeks

This is an on-demand pricing tool. It allows you to manually set every parameterâ€”from the option's strike and maturity to the specific parameters of the selected financial model. It's an ideal environment for:

- Building intuition about how different parameters affect option prices and Greeks.
- Performing sensitivity analysis.
- Comparing the output of different numerical techniques for the same model.

### 2. Calibration & IV

This page is the front-end for the model calibration workflow. Here you can:

- Select one or more models (e.g., BSM, Merton) to calibrate against a chosen market data snapshot.
- Visualize the results of the calibration, including the final Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE).
- Analyze the resulting **Implied Volatility (IV) surface** of the calibrated model against the market's IV surface.
- View **volatility smiles** and **error heatmaps** to diagnose mispricings and understand model fit.

### 3. Market Analytics

This page is an exploratory tool for option chain data. It allows you to load a live or historical snapshot and visualize key metrics for a chosen expiry date, including:

- Total **Volume** and **Open Interest** for calls vs. puts.
- An Open Interest "pyramid" showing concentrations across different strike prices.
- The statistical distribution of Implied Volatility across the chain.

### 4. Model Fitting

This page contains tools for quantitative research, allowing you to:

- Generate a **Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot** to visually assess if a stock's historical returns conform to a normal distribution (a key assumption of the BSM model).
- Fit jump parameters for a Merton-style process directly from historical returns using the method of moments.

### 5. Term Structure

This page is dedicated to interest rate models. It allows you to price Zero-Coupon Bonds and visualize the resulting yield curve generated by the Vasicek or CIR short-rate models.
