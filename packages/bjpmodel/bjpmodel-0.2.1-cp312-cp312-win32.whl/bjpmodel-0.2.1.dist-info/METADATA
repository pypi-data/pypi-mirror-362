## Overview

**BJP** is a high-performance Python package (with Cython/C++ backend) for fitting multivariate normal distributions using Gibbs sampling, with support for left and right censoring. 
Typically, BJP is used for modelling with transformed variables using the norm-transform package. Therefore, it is designed for statistical modeling and forecasting in scenarios where data may be treated as partially observed (e.g. rainfall).

---

## Features

- Fast Gibbs sampling for multivariate normal distributions
- Handles left and right censoring (if required)
- Generates ensemble predictions with posterior predictive sampling
- Cython/C++ backend for performance

## Installation

**Recommended**: Using a virtual environment and installing into. A [python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/virtual-environments/) is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version, along with additional packages. It allows you to isolate dependencies for different projects.

Use the package manager pip to install normtransform.

```bash
python -m venv venv # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual enviroment, on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install bjpmodel #install bjpmodel
```

> Note: See compatible versions

## Example Usage

This [demo.py](./bjpmodel/demo.py) can be used as example for BJP.
Once a python environment has been build and activated you can run `demo.py` from the commandline with `python ./bjpmodel/demo.py`

```cmd
python ./bjpmodel/demo.py
