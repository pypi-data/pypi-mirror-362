abstract: "EasyVVUQ is an open source Python library designed to facilitate verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of simulations. The goal of EasyVVUQ is to make it as easy as possible to implement advanced VVUQ techniques for existing application codes or workflows. Our aim is to expose these features in an accessible way for users of scientific software, in particular for simulation codes running on high performance computers."
