"""
Custom SendMessage Tool with Context Example

Demonstrates SendMessage with key moments and decisions via secret tool responses.
Multi-turn conversation proves that key decisions are passed correctly between agents.

Shows two approaches:
1. Agent-level: Set send_message_tool_class on individual Agents (per-agent customization)
2. Agency-level: Set send_message_tool_class on Agency (applies to all agents)

Run with: python examples/custom_send_message_with_context.py
