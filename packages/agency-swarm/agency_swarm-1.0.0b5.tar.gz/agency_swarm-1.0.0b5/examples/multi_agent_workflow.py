"""
Multi-Agent Collaboration Example with Validation

This example demonstrates and validates that multi-agent communication works correctly
in Agency Swarm. It creates a financial analysis workflow where:

1. PortfolioManager (orchestrator) - Gathers market data and coordinates analysis
2. RiskAnalyst (specialist) - Analyzes investment risks using specialized tools
3. ReportGenerator (specialist) - Formats professional investment reports

The validation system confirms:
✅ All required tools are called by the appropriate agents
✅ Information flows between agents (each agent's expertise appears in final output)
✅ Multiple conversation steps occur (indicating agent-to-agent communication)
✅ Final output is comprehensive and includes contributions from all agents

Run with: python examples/multi_agent_workflow.py
