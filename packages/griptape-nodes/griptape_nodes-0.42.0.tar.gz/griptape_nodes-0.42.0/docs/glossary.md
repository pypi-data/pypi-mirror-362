# Griptape Nodes Glossary for Artists & Creators

## What is Griptape Nodes?

Griptape Nodes is a toolkit that enables artists and creators to build AI-powered projects without the need for deep technical expertise. You can think of Griptape Nodes as a set of building blocks that you can connect together to create art, generate images, process text, or even build other workflow-centric applications.

### Core Griptape Nodes Concepts

- **Workflow**: A document containing nodes, connections, and values. While technically a Workflow is also a Script, avoid calling them Scripts, so that the term Script can communicate a clearly different thing than the term Workflow. This is also what we call the saved file.

- **Workflow Editor**: The workspace where nodes are added, connected, and configured.

- **Flow**: A collection of connected nodes that form a functional unit. A Workflow can contain 0-n Flows.

- **Sub-Flow**: A contained set of nodes that executes within a Loop, Branch, Reference (and sometimes Groups). This refers to any logically distinct, internally-contained portion of a flow that functions as a cohesive unit.

- **Reference**: A link to another Flow, embedding it as a Sub-Flow within the current context.

- **Group**: A visual clustering of nodes. A Group may act as a Sub-Flow if it is executed as a unit, but grouping alone does not imply execution and may simply be a subjectively related set of nodes.

- **Script**: A Python script that runs code. This term should be avoided when describing a Workflow; instead, script refers to tools, macros, or flow-building aids.

- **Libraries**: Collections of node definitions and/or scripts that extend functionality

- **Node**: A single piece of the puzzle in your workflow. Nodes are like LEGO blocks that you can connect to create something bigger. Each node does one specific thing (like generating an image or processing text). There are **types** of nodes:

    - **DataNode**: A node that handles information — it can transform data from one form to another, or simply hold data you set.
    - **ControlNode**: A node that will "do some work". Control Nodes usually take longer to run than DataNodes because, they're usually doing more work.
    - **DriverNode**: A node that connects your project to outside services (like image generators or search engines).

- **Tool**: A ready-to-use component that performs a specific function. Tools are like brushes in your digital toolkit — each designed for a specific purpose.

    - **CalculatorTool**: Does math calculations for you.
    - **DateTimeTool**: Works with dates and times.
    - **FileManagerTool**: Helps manage files (saving, loading, etc.).
    - **WebScraperTool**: Collects information from websites.
    - **PromptSummaryTool**: Creates summaries of longer text.

- **Driver**: The connector between your project and external AI services or databases. Drivers are like adapters that let your project talk to specialized services.

    - **PromptDriver**: Communicates with AI text generators (like GPT models).
    - **WebSearchDriver**: Connects to search engines to find information.
    - **EmbeddingDriver**: Transforms words and concepts into numerical form that AI can understand.
    - **ImageGenerationDriver**: Connects to AI image generators (like DALL-E).
    - **AudioTranscriptionDriver**: Converts spoken audio to written text.

- **Engine**: The powerhouse that processes your creative requests. Engines are specialized components that transform inputs into creative outputs.

    - **RagEngine**: Processes questions and generates answers based on provided information.
    - **PromptSummaryEngine**: Creates concise summaries of longer text.
    - **CsvExtractionEngine**: Pulls information from spreadsheet-like files.
    - **JsonExtractionEngine**: Pulls information from structured data files.

- **Artifact**: A piece of content created during your project, like a generated image or text. Artifacts are the outputs of your creative process.

    - **ErrorArtifact**: A notification when something goes wrong.

- **Agent**: A helper that can perform tasks on your behalf, often using a combination of tools. Agents are like assistants that can navigate a sequence of operations for you.

- **Ruleset**: A set of guidelines that control how your project behaves. Rulesets are like recipes that tell your project how to respond in different situations.

    - **Rule**: A single instruction within a ruleset, like "if the user asks for an image, generate one."

### Node Contents and Activities

- **Parameter**: A setting or value you can adjust on a node. Parameters are like the knobs and sliders in a music synthesizer — they let you fine-tune how things work.

    - **ParameterMode**: Describes if a parameter is for input, output, internal, or any combination.

    - **ParameterValue**: The "internal" value for a parameter (this is the data the node works with internally)

    - **ParameterOutputValues**: The results or "output" value for your parameters (this is the data that results from what the node did)

    - **ParameterUIOptions**: Settings for how parameters appear in the user interface.

    - **Port**: The circular indicators displayed on the left and/or right sides of a parameter. Ports on the left side indicate the parameter can accept incoming connections, while ports on the right side indicate the parameter supports outgoing connections.

    - **Pin**: Interchangeable with "Port"

- **Default Value**: The pre-set value a parameter has before you change it. This is like the factory settings on a device.

- **Parameter Validation**: A check that ensures the values you enter make sense. This prevents errors like trying to use text where a number is needed.

- **Off-prompt**: A Griptape secret-sauce way to keep some information private, even when working with LLMs.

- **Stream Mode**: A continuous processing mode, like a live video feed rather than taking separate photos.

- **Type Hints**: Labels that suggest what kind of information a parameter expects. These are like labels on art supply containers telling you what's inside.

    - **Any**: A type hint meaning a parameter can accept any kind of information.
    - **List**: A type hint for a collection of items (like an array of colors or shapes).
    - **Literal**: A type hint indicating a parameter only accepts specific preset values.
    - **Union type**: A type hint showing a parameter can accept multiple specific types of information.

- **Connection**: The link that allows nodes to communicate with each other. Connections are like the cables connecting different pieces of equipment.

## Technical Terms Made Simple

    - **Set (set)**: An unordered collection of unique items, like {1, 2, 3} or {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}.
    - **None (NoneType)**: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
