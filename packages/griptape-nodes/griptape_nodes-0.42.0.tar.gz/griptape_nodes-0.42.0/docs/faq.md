# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where is my workspace (where do my files save)?

Files such as saved workflows, etc., are saved in a the Workspace Directory.

The path for the Workspace Directory can be found in the Griptape Nodes Editor:

1. Open the Griptape Nodes Editor.
1. Open an existing workflow or create a blank one.
1. Click "Settings".
1. Select "Configuration Editor".
1. Click "Griptape Nodes Settings" on the leftmost column, if not already selected.
1. The path is listed under "Workspace Directory".

If you are not running the Editor, run this command and it will report back your Workspace Directory:

```bash
gtn config show | grep workspace
```

## Can I run the Engine on a different machine than the Editor?

The Engine and Editor can run on completely separate machines. Remember that any files you save or libraries you register will be stored on the machine where the Engine is running. So if you're looking for your files and can't find them right away, double-check which machine the Engine is running on.

## Where is Griptape Nodes installed?

Looking for the exact installation location of your Griptape Nodes? This command will show you precisely where it's installed:

For Mac/Linux:

```bash
dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which griptape-nodes)))
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$(Split-Path -Parent (Split-Path -Parent (Get-Command griptape-nodes | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source)))
```

## Can I see or edit my config file?

To get a path to the file, go to the top Settings menu in the Editor, and select **Copy Path to Settings**. That will copy the config file path to your clipboard.

If you prefer working in the command line, you can also use:

```
gtn config show
```

## How do I install the Advanced Media Library after Initial Setup?

If you initially declined to install the Advanced Media Library during setup but now want to add it, you can do so by running:

```bash
gtn init
```

This will restart the configuration process. You can press Enter to keep your existing workspace and Griptape Cloud API Key settings. When prompted with:

```
Register Advanced Media Library? [y/n] (n):
```

Press **y** to install the Advanced Media Library, or **n** to skip installation.

!!! note

    Some nodes in the Advanced Media Library require specific models to function properly. You will need to install these models separately.

    Refer to each node's documentation to determine which nodes need which models; they each have links to specific requirements.

## How do I uninstall Griptape Nodes?

```bash
griptape-nodes self uninstall
```

To reinstall, follow the instructions on the [installation](installation.md) page.

## How do I update Griptape Nodes?

Griptape Nodes will automatically check if it needs to update every time it runs. If it does, you will be prompted to answer with a (y/n) response. Respond with a y and it will automatically update to the latest version of the Engine.

If you would like to _manually_ update, you can always use either of these commands:

```bash
griptape-nodes self update
griptape-nodes libraries sync
```

or

```bash
gtn self update
gtn libraries sync
```

## I'm seeing `failed to locate pyvenv.cfg: The system cannot find the file specified.` - What should I do?

It is possible, that during a previous uninstall things were not _fully_ uninstalled. Simply perform an uninstall again, and then [re-install](installation.md).

## I'm seeing `Attempted to create a Flow with a parent 'None', but no parent with that name could be found.` - What should I do?

The good news is, this is usually harmless, and you can usually disregard it. If you're getting it in a way that stops work, please restart your engine, and that should take care of it.

That said, we apologize for this elusive bug. We're working to catch and fix it as soon as possible. If you are so inclined, we'd be grateful if you wanted to [log a bug](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml&title=Attempted%20to%20create%20flow%20with%20a%20parent%20%27None%27) and provide any context around what may have led to the issue when you see it!

## I'm receiving an error when trying to run Griptape Nodes: `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1000)` - What should I do?

The Python installation on your machine may not have access to verified SSL certificates. To remedy:

1. Reinstall Python using the python.org installer. As of this writing, Griptape Nodes requires Python 3.12.
1. At the end of the installation, select to "Install Certificates".
    1. If not available in the installer, run `/Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command`

## How can I test out unreleased features?

If you're interested in testing out unreleased features, you can install the pre-release builds of Griptape Nodes.
Updates are now published to the [latest](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes/releases/tag/latest) tag twice a day.

!!! warning

    Pre-release builds are not guaranteed to be stable and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Use them at your own risk.

To switch to the pre-release update channel, run the following commands:

```
uv tool uninstall griptape-nodes
uv tool install git+https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes.git@latest --reinstall --force --python 3.12
```

This will uninstall the current version of Griptape Nodes and install the latest pre-release build from the GitHub repository.

!!! info

    Uninstalling using `uv tool uninstall griptape-nodes` will not remove your existing projects or settings. It only removes the Griptape Nodes engine itself.

You can confirm it went through by running `gtn self version`. Your version number should show a reference to a git commit:

```
gtn self version
v0.31.0 (git - e172e80)
```

To switch back to the stable release channel, run the following commands:

```
uv tool uninstall griptape-nodes
uv tool install griptape-nodes
```
