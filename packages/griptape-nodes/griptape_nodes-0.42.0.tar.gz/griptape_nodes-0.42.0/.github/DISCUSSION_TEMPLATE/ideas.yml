        ## ðŸ§  Title Tip
        When filling in the title, consider using a helpful prefix based on your selection. Here are some examples:
        - `[New Node] An image diff node`
        - `[New Feature] Add a way to group nodes together and label them`
        - `[New Library] I'd love a node library for image processing`
        - `[Tooling Improvement] Improve build times`
        - `[Docs/Examples] Add more usage examples`
        - `[Other] Your idea title`

        This helps us scan and categorize things faster. You can always change it later if you want!
