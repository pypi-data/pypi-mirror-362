# CORE Architecture

This document outlines the core architecture of a Cacao project.

## Overview

Cacao is designed as a high-performance, reactive web framework for Python, focused on providing:

- **Decorator-based API** for easy route and page creation.
- **Reactive state management** for dynamic UI updates.
- **JSON-driven UI rendering** to define layouts and components.
- **Real-time updates via WebSocket** for seamless interactivity.
- **Extensible plugin system** for adding features like authentication, theming, and metrics.
- **Built-in UI components** for inputs, data display, and layouts.
- **Optimizations** using VDOM diffing and async support.

## Key Principles

- **Modularity:** Each component of the framework is isolated for clarity and maintainability.
- **Reactivity:** Inspired by modern frameworks like React and Vue, Cacao provides a reactive state system.
- **Simplicity:** Python’s simplicity is leveraged for an intuitive development experience.
