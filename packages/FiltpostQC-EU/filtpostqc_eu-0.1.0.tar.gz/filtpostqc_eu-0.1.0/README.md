# FiltpostQC-EU

**FiltpostQC-EU** is a command-line tool designed to apply post-GWAS quality control (QC) filtering to merged summary statistics files (e.g., from REGENIE) using an external variant filter file. It supports filtered output, FUMA-compatible output, or both.

Developed by **Etienne Kabongo**, research assistant at the Audrey Grant Lab.
