# InferPloidy
## Brief introduction
- InferPloidy is a CNV-based, ploidy annotation tool for single-cell RNA-seq data.
- It works with the CNV-estimates obtained from [infercnv](https://github.com/icbi-lab/infercnvpy) .

## Cite InferPloidy
- "InferPloidy: A fast ploidy inference tool accurately classifies cells with abnormal CNVs in large single-cell RNA-seq datasets", available at [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.13.643178)

## Installation using pip, importing inferploidy in Python

InferPloidy can be installed using pip command. With python3 installed in your system, simply use the follwing command in a terminal.

`pip install inferploidy`

Once it is installed using pip, you can import two functions using the following python command.

`from inferploidy import run_infercnv, run_inferploidy`

## Example usage in Jupyter notebook

`inferPloidy_example.ipynb` is example code in Jupyter notebook, where you can see how to import and run InferPloidy. 

To run HiCAT, you need the pre-installed python packages `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `scikit-network`, `infercnvpy` and , `hicat`.
`hicat` is used to annotate cell-type to collect reference cells for infercnv.
All of them can be installed simply using `pip` command.
