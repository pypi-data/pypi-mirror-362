This module extends the functionality of the Helpdesk by allowing users
to convert a Helpdesk Ticket into a CRM Lead. This can be particularly
useful when a customer contacts your company with an issue that
represents a potential business opportunity.

By converting the ticket into a lead, you can track and manage this
opportunity through the sales pipeline.
