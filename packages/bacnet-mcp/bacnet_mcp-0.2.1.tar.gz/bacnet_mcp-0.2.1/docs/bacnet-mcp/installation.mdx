The server is built with [FastMCP 2.0](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome) and uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for project and dependency management. Simply run the following command to install `uv` or check out the [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more details and alternative installation methods.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Clone the repository, then use `uv` to install project dependencies and create a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezhuk/bacnet-mcp.git
cd bacnet-mcp
uv sync
```

Start the BACnet MCP server by running the following command in your terminal. It defaults to using the `Streamable HTTP` transport on portâ€¯`8000`.

```bash
uv run bacnet-mcp
```

To confirm the server is up and running and explore available resources and tools, run the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and connect it to the BACnet MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/`. Make sure to set the transport to `Streamable HTTP`.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
