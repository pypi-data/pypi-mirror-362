           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# RumbleDB for Python

by Abishek Ramdas and Ghislain Fourny

This is the Python edition of [RumbleDB](https://rumbledb.org/), which brings [JSONiq](https://www.jsoniq.org) to the world of Spark and DataFrames. JSONiq is a language considerably more powerful than SQL as it can process [messy, heterogeneous datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11582), from kilobytes to Petabytes, with very little coding effort.

The Python edition of RumbleDB is currently only a prototype (alpha) and probably unstable. We welcome bug reports.

## About RumbleDB

RumbleDB is a JSONiq engine that works both with very small amounts of data and very large amounts of data.
It works with JSON, CSV, text, Parquet, etc (and soon XML).
It works on your laptop as well as on any Spark cluster (AWS, company clusters, etc).

It automatically detects and switches between execution modes in a way transparent to the user, bringing the convenience of data independence to the world of messy data.

It is an academic project, natively in Java, carried out at ETH Zurich by many students over more than 8 years: Stefan Irimescu, Renato Marroquin, Rodrigo Bruno, Falko Noé, Ioana Stefan, Andrea Rinaldi, Stevan Mihajlovic, Mario Arduini, Can Berker Çıkış, Elwin Stephan, David Dao, Zirun Wang, Ingo Müller, Dan-Ovidiu Graur, Thomas Zhou, Olivier Goerens, Alexandru Meterez, Pierre Motard, Remo Röthlisberger, Dominik Bruggisser, David Loughlin, David Buzatu, Marco Schöb, Maciej Byczko, Matteo Agnoletto, Dwij Dixit.

It is free and open source, under an Apache 2.0 license, which can also be used commercially (but on an as-is basis with no guarantee).

## High-level information on the library

A RumbleSession is a wrapper around a SparkSession that additionally makes sure the RumbleDB environment is in scope.

JSONiq queries are invoked with rumble.jsoniq() in a way similar to the way Spark SQL queries are invoked with spark.sql().

Any number of Python DataFrames can be attached to external JSONiq variables used in the query. It will later also be possible to read tables registered in the Hive metastore, similar to spark.sql(). Alternatively, the JSONiq query can also read many files of many different formats from many places (local drive, HTTP, S3, HDFS, ...) directly with simple builtin function calls such as json-lines(), text-file(), parquet-file(), csv-file(), etc. See [RumbleDB's documentation](https://rumble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The resulting sequence of items can be retrieved as DataFrame, as an RDD, as a Python list, or with a streaming iteration over the items.

The individual items can be processed using the RumbleDB [Item API](https://github.com/RumbleDB/rumble/blob/master/src/main/java/org/rumbledb/api/Item.java).

Alternatively, it is possible to directly get a Python list of JSON values, or a streaming iteration of JSON values. This is a convenience that makes it unnecessary to use the Item API, especially for a first-time user.

It is also possible to write the sequence of items to the local disk, to HDFS, to S3, etc in a way similar to how DataFrames are written back by Spark.

The design goal is that it should be possible to chain DataFrames between JSONiq and Spark SQL queries seamlessly. For example, JSONiq can be used to clean up very messy data and turn it into a clean DataFrame, which can then be processed with Spark SQL, spark.ml, etc.

Any feedback or error reports are very welcome.

## Installation

Install with
```
pip install jsoniq
```

## Sample code

We will make more documentation available as we go. In the meantime, you will find a sample code below that should just run
after installing the library.

```
from jsoniq import RumbleSession

# The syntax to start a session is similar to that of Spark.
# A RumbleSession is a SparkSession that additionally knows about RumbleDB.
# All attributes and methods of SparkSession are also available on RumbleSession. 
rumble = RumbleSession.builder.appName("PyRumbleExample").getOrCreate();

# Create a data frame also similar to Spark (but using the rumble object).
data = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25), ("Charlie", 35)];
columns = ["Name", "Age"];
df = rumble.createDataFrame(data, columns);

# This is how to bind a JSONiq variable to a dataframe. You can bind as many variables as you want.
rumble.bindDataFrameAsVariable('$a', df);

# This is how to run a query. This is similar to spark.sql().
# Since variable $a was bound to a DataFrame, it is automatically declared as an external variable
# and can be used in the query. In JSONiq, it is logically a sequence of objects.
res = rumble.jsoniq('$a.Name');

# There are several ways to collect the outputs, depending on the user needs but also
# on the query supplied.
# This returns a list containing one or several of "DataFrame", "RDD", "PUL", "Local"
# If DataFrame is in the list, df() can be invoked.
# If RDD is in the list, rdd() can be invoked.
# If Local is the list, items() or json() can be invokved, as well as the local iterator API.
modes = res.availableOutputs();
for mode in modes:
    print(mode)

###### Parallel access ######

# This returns a regular data frame that can be further processed with spark.sql() or rumble.jsoniq().
df = res.df();
df.show();

##### Local access ######

# This materializes the rows as items.
# The items are accessed with the RumbleDB Item API.
list = res.items();
for result in list:
    print(result.getStringValue())

# This streams through the items one by one
res.open();
while (res.hasNext()):
    print(res.next().getStringValue());
res.close();

###### Native Python/JSON Access for bypassing the Item API (but losing on the richer JSONiq type system) ######

# This method directly gets the result as JSON (dict, list, strings, ints, etc).
jlist = res.json();
for str in jlist:
    print(str);

# This streams through the JSON values one by one.
res.open();
while(res.hasNext()):
    print(res.nextJSON());
res.close();

# This gets an RDD of JSON values that can be processed by Python
rdd = res.rdd();
print(rdd.count());
for str in rdd.take(10):
    print(str);

# It is also possible to write the output to a file locally or on a cluster. The API is similar to that of Spark dataframes.
# Note that it creates a directory and stores the (potentially very large) output in a sharded directory.
# RumbleDB was already tested with up to 64 AWS machines and 100s of TBs of data.
# Of course the examples below are so small that it makes more sense to process the results locally with Python,
# but this shows how GBs or TBs of data obtained from JSONiq can be written back to disk.
seq = rumble.jsoniq("$a.Name");
seq.write().mode("overwrite").json("outputjson");
seq.write().mode("overwrite").parquet("outputparquet");

seq = rumble.jsoniq("1+1");
seq.write().mode("overwrite").text("outputtext");

# A more complex, standalone query

seq = rumble.jsoniq("""

let $stores :=
[
  { "store number" : 1, "state" : "MA" },
  { "store number" : 2, "state" : "MA" },
  { "store number" : 3, "state" : "CA" },

   { "product" : "shirt", "store number" : 3, "quantity" : 10 }
]
let $join :=
  for $store in $stores[], $sale in $sales[]
  where $store."store number" = $sale."store number"
  return {
    "nb" : $store."store number",
    "state" : $store.state,
    "sold" : $sale.product
  }
return [$join]
""");

print(seq.json());

seq = rumble.jsoniq("""
