A user-friendly SMLM analysis platfrom for napari, which includes single molecule localisation, tracking, and analysis features. 
Based on established python packages such as **Picasso**, **GPUfit** and **Trackpy**.
This plugin was designed to detect/track single molecules inside cells, but can be used for any other SMLM/tracking application.

All functions are parallelised/GPU accelerated where possible to increase performance.
Multiple datasets can be loaded and processed in parallel.

Single molecule localisations can be filtered by their properties (e.g. photons, width, etc.) and can be rendered as a super resolution image.

Napari-moltrack is also compatible with **FRET** and **ALEX FRET** image data, can be used to calculate FRET efficiencies of single molecules/tracks.

Segmentations can be used to exclude regions from single molecule localisation and tracking.
Segmentations can be added automatically using Cellpose or can be added manually. Includes tools for editing/modifying segmentations at a sub-pixel resolution.

Compatible with both single and multi-channel .tif and .fits files.

napari-moltrack was written by Piers Turner, Kapanidis Group, University of Oxford.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-moltrack` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-moltrack

To update `napari-moltrack` to the latest version, use:

    pip install napari-moltrack --upgrade

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/piedrro/napari-moltrack.git


## BactFit

napari-moltrack integrates BactFit, a package for fitting the shape of rod shaped bacterial cells to an ideal cell model.
BactFit allows cell renders and heatmaps to be generated through the transformation of SMLM localisations to an ideal cell model.
