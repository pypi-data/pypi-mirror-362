        "Chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita sets the scene where the two armies of Kauravas "
        "and Pandavas are juxtaposed in the field of Kurukshetra. Sanjay is granted divine vision "
        "by sage Ved Vyas to see the whole saga so that he can narrate it to Dhritrashtra, "
        "father of Duryodhan. Sanjay describes the expanse of the armies of both sides to Dhritrashtra "
        "and the valor of the mighty warriors on each side. Sanjay also mentions that victory is certain "
        "for the side where Shri Krishna is. Arjuna is mounted in a chariot controlled by Shri Krishna, "
        "the Lord of three lokas. Arjun is disheartened to see all his relatives standing in the opposite army "
        "as his adversaries, who until yesterday were merely friends. Due to his mental dilemma, Arjun first requests "
        "Shri Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies so that he can see all those who have stood against him. "
        "Dominated by 'Satgun' (the quality of love and affection), Arjuna drops his weapon and retreats to the back of the chariot, "
        "citing reasons that he cannot all of a sudden kill those whom he had until now considered his own. "
        "He even expresses a desire that if Duryodhan kills him right now, then the whole carnage would be averted. "
        "Arjun thus seeks the refuge of Shri Krishna."
    ),
    2: (
        "In this chapter, Arjun reiterates to Shree Krishna that he is unable to cope with his current situation,"
        "where he has to kill his elders and teachers. He refuses to take part in such a battle and requests Shree"
        "Krishna to be his spiritual teacher and guide him on the proper path of action. Then the Supreme Lord"
        "starts imparting divine knowledge to Arjun. He begins with the immortal-nature of the soul, which is"
        "eternal and imperishable. Death only destroys the physical body, but the soul continues its journey."
        "Just as a person discards his old clothes and adorns new ones, the soul "
        "keeps changing bodies from one lifetime to another."
        "The Lord then reminds Arjun that his social responsibility as a warrior is to fight for upholding righteousness."
        "He explains that performing one’s social duty is a virtuous act that can take him to the celestial abodes," 
        "while dereliction only leads to infamy and humiliation."
        "At first, Shree Krishna tries to motivate Arjun at a mundane level. Then he moves deeper and "
        "starts explaining to Arjun the Science of Work."
        "He asks Arjun to perform his deeds without any attachment to their fruits."
        "This science of working without desire for rewards is called the yog of the intellect or buddhi-yog."
        "He further advises that the intellect should be used to control the desire for rewards from work."
        "By working with such intent, the bondage-creating karmas get transformed into bondage-breaking "
        "karmas and a state beyond sorrows can be attained."
        "Arjun is curious to know more about those who are situated in divine consciousness. Shree Krishna, therefore, describes how"
        "persons who have attained transcendence are free from attachment, fear, and anger."
        "They are undisturbed and equipoised in every situation. With their senses subdued, they keep their minds always absorbed in God."
        "He also explains the progression of afflictions of the mind—such as greed, anger, lust, etc. and advises how these can be overcome."

    ),
    3: (
        "Shree Krishna expounds on karm yog or the yog of action in this chapter. He explains to Arjun that nobody "
        "can remain without action, even for a moment. Bound by their inherent modes of nature, all beings"
        "are always engaged in some work. Superior are those who practice karm yog and continue to"
        "work diligently to fulfill their responsibilities externally, but internally they are unattached to them. However, the hypocrites display"
        "external renunciation but internally dwell upon the objects of their senses."
        "Shree Krishna says that all living beings are an integral part of God’s creation and have roles and responsibilities to fulfill."
        "Vedas prescribe performing yajña to please the celestial gods, who in-return bestow material gains."
        "These yajñas cause rains to fall, which aids in the production of food grains for the sustenance of life on earth."
        "Those who live only for the delight of their senses and do not accept their responsibility in this cycle— are sinful and living in vain."
        "However, Shree Krishna says that when works or prescribed duties are performed as an obligation to God, they are also considered yajña (sacrifice)."
        "He then explains that unlike the rest of humankind, the enlightened souls are not obliged to fulfill their bodily responsibilities."
        "They are situated in knowledge of the self and execute higher responsibilities of the soul. However, they do not abandon their social duties,"
        "as it may create disharmony in the minds of the common people who look up to them for inspiration. Therefore, the wise continue to work without any"
        "personal motive only to set good examples for others to follow, else, the ignorant may abandon their prescribed duties prematurely. Shree Krishna" 
        "mentions one such example of the enlightened King Janak, who performed his earthly duties as an ideal king and father. Arjun then asks Shree Krishna"
        "why people commit sin, even when unwilling, as if by some force. Lord Krishna explains that lust alone is the sinful all-devouring enemy."
        "Similar to a fire that is covered by smoke or a mirror covered in dust, desire shrouds one’s knowledge and deludes the intellect."
        "In the end, Shree Krishna advises Arjun that by controlling the senses, mind, and intellect—one can slay this enemy" 
        "called desire, which is an embodiment of sin."
    ),
    4: (
        "To strengthen Arjun’s faith in the knowledge He is imparting, Shree Krishna reveals its pristine origin in this chapter."
        "He says, “Arjun, as you are my devotee and a dear friend, I am revealing this supreme science of yog to you. It is the same eternal"
        "science that I taught to the Sun God at the beginning of time. And in a continuous tradition, the same knowledgge; was passed"
        "to the saintly kings.” Arjun wonders how someone who is almost his age could exist so many eons ago. He asks Shree Krishna"
        "how is it possible that you gave this knowledge to the Sun God and the others so many years back in time."
        "Shree Krishna clarifies Arjun’s doubts and discloses the divine mystery of His descension. He says that"
        "although God is unborn and eternal, it is to establish dharma (the path of righteousness) that He descends on this earth by His Yogmaya power."
        "His birth and activities are divine and cannot get tainted by material imperfections. Once a devotee knows this secret and engages"
        "in devotion with great faith, he attains God and does not take birth in this world again."
        "Then Shree Krishna goes back to karm yog, the subject from the previous chapter. He continues to explain the nature of work and"
        "its three principles: action, in-action, and forbidden action."
        "He elaborates that the karm yogis, even while performing the most engaging task, are in the state of inaction and do not get entangled"
        "in the karmic reactions of such action. Knowing this: the ancient sages performed all their work as an act of"
        "sacrifice for the pleasure of God.  They were not affected by happiness, distress, success, or failure. He explains that when"
        "sacrifice is suitably dedicated, performed with proper knowledge and pure sentiments, then its remnants"
        "become like nectar. And by partaking such nectar, the devotees are cleansed of all impurities. Even the biggest"
        "sinner can cross over the ocean of material miseries by boarding this boat of eternal knowledge."
        "Shree Krishna says that such knowledge should be acquired only from a genuine spiritual master, who"
        "himself is God-realized. Being his Guru, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to cut apart all doubts that have arisen in his heart with"
        "this sword of knowledge. He asks Arjun to now get up and perform his duty as a warrior."
    ),
    5:(
        "Shree Krishna compares karm sanyās yog (the path of renunciation of actions) with karm yog (the path of work in devotion)."
        "He says: we can choose either of the two paths, as both lead to the same destination. However, he explains that the renunciation of"
        "actions is rather challenging and can only be performed flawlessly by those whose minds are adequately pure. Purification of the"
        "mind can be achieved only by working in devotion. Therefore, karm yog is a more appropriate path for the majority of humankind."
        "The karm yogis with a purified intellect perform their worldly duties without any attachment to its fruit. They dedicate all their"
        "works and its results to God. Just as a lotus leaf that floats on water does not get wet, the karm yogis also remain unaffected by sin."
        "They are aware that the soul resides within the body that is like a city with nine gates. Therefore, they do not consider themselves"
        "to be the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions. Endowed with the vision of equality, they look equally upon a Brahmin, a cow, an"
        "elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. Seated in the Absolute Truth, such truly learned people develop flawless qualities similar to God."
        "The ignorant worldly people do not realize that the pleasures they strive to relish from their sense objects are the very source of their"
        "misery. However, the karm yogis do not get any joy from such worldly pleasures. Instead, they enjoy the bliss of God, who resides inside them."
        "Lord Shree Krishna then describes karm sanyās yog or the path of renunciation. He says that the karm sanyāsīs control their mind,"
        "intellect, and senses by performing several austerities. By shutting out all their thoughts of external pleasures, they become free"
        "from fear, desire, and anger. And by including devotion to God in all their austerities, they attain long-lasting peace."

        1.36: "O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them.",

        2.45: "The Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature, O Arjun. Rise above the three modes to a state of pure spiritual consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in Truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self.",
        2.46: "Whatever purpose is served by a small well of water is naturally served in all respects by a large lake. Similarly, one who realizes the Absolute Truth also fulfills the purpose of all the Vedas.",
        2.47: "You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.",
        2.48: "Be steadfast in the performance of your duty, O Arjun, abandoning attachment to success and failure. Such equanimity is called Yog.",
        2.49: "Seek refuge in divine knowledge and insight, O Arjun, and discard reward-seeking actions that are certainly inferior to works performed with the intellect established in divine knowledge. Miserly are those who seek to enjoy the fruits of their works.",
        2.50: "One who prudently practices the science of work without attachment can get rid of both good and bad reactions in this life itself. Therefore, strive for Yog, which is the art of working skillfully (in proper consciousness).",
        2.51: "The wise endowed with equanimity of intellect, abandon attachment to the fruits of actions, which bind one to the cycle of life and death. By working in such consciousness, they attain the state beyond all suffering.",
        2.52: "When your intellect crosses the quagmire of delusion, you will then acquire indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard (about enjoyments in this world and the next).",
        2.53: "When your intellect ceases to be allured by the fruitive sections of the Vedas and remains steadfast in divine consciousness, you will then attain the state of perfect Yog.",
        2.54: "Arjun said : O Keshav, what is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? How does an enlightened person talk? How does he sit? How does he walk?",
        2.55: "The Supreme Lord said: O Parth, when one discards all selfish desires and cravings of the senses that torment the mind, and becomes satisfied in the realization of the self, such a person is said to be transcendentally situated.",
        2.56: "One whose mind remains undisturbed amidst misery, who does not crave for pleasure, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.",
        2.57: "One who remains unattached under all conditions, and is neither delighted by good fortune nor dejected by tribulation, he is a sage with perfect knowledge.",
        2.58: "One who is able to withdraw the senses from their objects, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell, is established in divine wisdom.",
        2.59: "Aspirants may restrain the senses from their objects of enjoyment, but the taste for the sense objects remains. However, even this taste ceases for those who realize the Supreme.",
        2.60: "The senses are so strong and turbulent, O son of Kunti, that they can forcibly carry away the mind even of a person endowed with discrimination who practices self-control.",
        2.61: "They are established in perfect knowledge, who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in Me.",
        2.62: "While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops attachment to them. Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger.",
        2.63: "Anger leads to clouding of judgment, which results in bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, the intellect gets destroyed; and when the intellect is destroyed, one is ruined.",
        2.64: "But one who controls the mind, and is free from attachment and aversion, even while using the objects of the senses, attains the Grace of God.",
        2.65: "By divine grace comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind soon becomes firmly established in God.",
        2.66: "But an undisciplined person, who has not controlled the mind and senses, can neither have a resolute intellect nor steady contemplation on God. For one who never unites the mind with God there is no peace; and how can one who lacks peace be happy?",
        2.67: "Just as a strong wind sweeps a boat off its chartered course on the water, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can lead the intellect astray.",

        2.69: "What all beings consider as day is the night of ignorance for the wise, and what all creatures see as night is the day for the introspective sage.",
        2.70: "Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him attains peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy desires.",
        2.71: "That person, who gives up all material desires and lives free from a sense of greed, proprietorship, and egoism, attains perfect peace.",
        2.72: "O Parth, such is the state of an enlightened soul that having attained it, one is never again deluded. Being established in this consciousness even at the hour of death, one is liberated from the cycle of life and death and reaches the Supreme Abode of God."
