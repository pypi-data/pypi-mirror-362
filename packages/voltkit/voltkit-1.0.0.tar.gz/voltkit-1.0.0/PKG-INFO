# ‚ö° VoltKit ‚Äî The Open Toolkit for Electrical & Electronics Engineering

VoltKit is an open-source Python library designed to make electrical and electronics engineering more practical, visual, and beginner-friendly.

From Ohm's Law to Phasor Diagrams, from FFTs to Streamlit-powered simulations ‚Äî VoltKit helps students, educators, and makers bring theoretical concepts to life using code.

---

## üöÄ Why VoltKit?

Electrical engineering is filled with complex formulas and repetitive calculations. VoltKit simplifies this by:

- Providing clean and tested Python functions for core EE concepts
- Offering ready-made simulators and calculators
- Including beautiful interactive visualizations using Streamlit
- Helping students build real projects, faster

## üß™ Usage Examples

### Ohm's Law
```python
from voltkit.core import voltage, resistance, current
# voltage(i,r)
# resistance(v,i)
# current(v,r)
v = voltage(2, 5)           # 10 volts
r = resistance(10,2)       # 5 ohms
i = current(10,5)          # 2 amps
```

### RLC Impedance
```python
from voltkit.core import resistor, inductor, capacitor
z_r = resistor(100)                     # 100 Œ©
z_l = inductor(10e-3, freq=1000)       # 62.8j Œ©
z_c = capacitor(1e-6, freq=1000)       # -159.1j Œ©
```

### Phasor Diagram for RL Circuit
```python
from voltkit.core import plot_rl_phasor_diagram
plot_rl_phasor_diagram(R=10, L=0.1, I=1, f=50)
```

### Generate a Sine Wave
```python
from voltkit.core import sine_wave
t, y = sine_wave(freq=50, duration=1, sample_rate=1000, amp=5)
```

## To Plot the sin wave
```python
from voltkit.core import sine_wave
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
t, y = sine_wave(freq=50, duration=1, sample_rate=1000, amp=5)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.plot(t, y, label='Sine Wave')
plt.ylabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()

```

## üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Streamlit Apps

VoltKit also includes pre-built apps for learning and visualizing concepts. Run them like this:

```bash
streamlit run voltkit/streamlit_ui/signal_generator_app.py
```
(If not work, then open Command Prompt and use this method)
```bash
cd voltkit
streamlit run voltkit/streamlit_ui/signal_generator_app.py
```


### Available Apps:

- `signal_generator_app.py`
- `bode_simulator_app.py`
- `fft_explorer_app.py`
