**ThinkSound** is a unified Any2Audio generation framework with flow matching guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

PyTorch implementation for multimodal audio generation and editing: generate or edit audio from video, text, and audio, powered by step-by-step reasoning from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

## 🚀 Features

- **Any2Audio**: Generate audio from arbitrary modalities — video, text, audio, or their combinations.
- **Video-to-Audio SOTA**: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple V2A benchmarks.
- **CoT-Driven Reasoning**: Chain-of-Thought reasoning for compositional and controllable audio generation via MLLMs.
- **Interactive Object-centric Editing**: Refine or edit specific sound events by clicking on visual objects or using text instructions.
- **Unified Framework**: One foundation model supports generation, editing, and interactive workflow.

---

## ✨ Method Overview

ThinkSound decomposes audio generation and editing into three interactive stages, all guided by MLLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning:

1. **Foley Generation:** Generate foundational, semantically and temporally aligned soundscapes from video.
2. **Object-Centric Refinement:** Refine or add sounds for user-specified objects via clicks or regions in the video.
3. **Targeted Audio Editing:** Modify generated audio using high-level natural language instructions.

![ThinkSound Overview](assets/figs/fig3_model.png)
<!-- A large-scale CoT-annotated dataset (**AudioCoT**) is used to train both the reasoning module and the unified audio foundation model.

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Environment Preparation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liuhuadai/ThinkSound.git
cd ThinkSound
conda create -n thinksound python=3.10
conda activate thinksound
pip install thinksound
conda install -y -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg<7'
# Download pretrained weights https://huggingface.co/liuhuadai/ThinkSound to Directory ckpts/
# model weights can be also downloaded from https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/ThinkSound
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/liuhuadai/ThinkSound ckpts
# To improve inference and training speed, you may optionally install a FlashAttention backend compatible with your system and PyTorch version.
```

> ✅ **Windows Tip:**  
> Windows users can simply run `setup_windows.bat` (or double-click it) to automatically create the conda environment, install all dependencies (including FFmpeg), and download the pretrained model — no manual setup required.  
> Make sure `conda` and `git` are installed and available in your system PATH before running the script.


### ▶️ Run the Demo

#### **Linux/macOS**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/demo.sh
./scripts/demo.sh <path-to-your-demo-video> <title> <CoT description> [use-half]
```

#### **Windows**

You can use the provided `.bat` script instead:

```bash
.\scripts\demo.bat <path-to-your-demo-video> <title> <CoT description> [use-half]
```

**Note:**

* `<path-to-your-demo-video>`: The path to a single video
* `[use-half]` (optional): Add use-half at the end to enable half precision feature extraction.

---

### 📦 Batch Inference

#### **Linux/macOS**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/eval_batch.sh
./scripts/eval_batch.sh <video_path> <csv_path> <save_path (optional)> [use-half]
```

#### **Windows**

Use the equivalent `.bat` script:

```bash
.\scripts\eval_batch.bat <video_path> <csv_path> <save_path (optional)> [use-half]
```

**Note:**

* `<video_path>`: Path to the root directory containing all .mp4 videos to be processed (all videos must be of equal duration).
* `<csv_path>`: A CSV file with text prompts for each video (see `demo_test.csv` for format).
* `<save_path>` (optional): Where to save generated audio. Defaults to `results/features`.
* `[use-half]` (optional): Add use-half at the end to enable half precision feature extraction.

### Web Interface Usage

For an interactive experience, launch the Gradio web interface:

```bash
python app.py
```
