`collective.bbcodesnippets <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.bbcodesnippets>`_ provides pervasive, generic and extensible `BBCode Markup <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode>`_ integration for Plone.

Functionality
=============

*collective.bbcodesnippets* replaces BBCode in the whole generated HTML output.
BBCode snippets can be placed everywhere in the site. 

At transform time at the end of the chain, before or after Diazo (configurable), the output is parsed and all BBCode will be replaced.

The BBCode parser only replaces configured BBCode snippets. 
At the control panel all registered BBCodes are listed to be activated.
By default all codes are inactive.

This package utilizes the excellent `bbcode package <https://pypi.org/project/bbcode/>`_  from Dan Watson to parse and replace.
We register all `default formatters <https://dcwatson.github.io/bbcode/tags/>`_ as named utilities which are used as factories for the formatter using the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA). 
Custom parsers can be provided by registering an own named utility.
Before parsing at transform time new Parser is created using the configured adapters only.

Further features:

- The Plone toolbar got a new menu to copy BBCode templates for the active BBCodes.
- TinyMCE got a new menu to insert BBCode templates.
- There is a demo page with all activated BBCodes at the portal root under ``@@bbcodesnippets-demo``.
- A boolean index ``has_bbcodes`` got added to the ``portal_catalog``.  
  Content with active or inactive BBCcodes in any of their text or richtext Dexterity schema fields are indexed ``True``.
