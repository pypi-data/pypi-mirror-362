Welcome to the dmqclib documentation!
=======================================

**dmqclib** is a Python library that provides a configuration-driven workflow for machine learning, simplifying dataset preparation, model training, and data classification. It is a core component of the AIQC project.

The library is designed around a three-stage workflow:

1.  **Dataset Preparation:** Ingest raw data and transform it into a feature-rich dataset ready for training.
2.  **Training & Evaluation:** Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.
3.  **Classification:** Apply a trained model to classify new, unseen data.

Each stage is controlled by a YAML configuration file, allowing you to define and reproduce your entire workflow with ease.
