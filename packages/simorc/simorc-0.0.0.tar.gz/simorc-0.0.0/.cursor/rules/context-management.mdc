# Context Management

This project uses a context directory to maintain continuity between chat sessions. The assistant should actively maintain these files throughout the project lifecycle.

## Context Structure

The context is stored in markdown files in the `context` directory:

```
context/
  ├── memory.md   # Project state, decisions, and knowledge
  └── todo.md     # Task tracking and completion status
```

## Setup

When first interacting with the project, the assistant should:

1. Check if the `context` directory exists; if not, suggest creating it
2. Check if required files exist; if not, suggest creating them with the templates below
3. Always review context files at the beginning of each session

## Memory File (memory.md)

Maintains the project's state, decisions, and knowledge.

### Template

```markdown
# Project Memory

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project]

## Current State
[Description of the current state of the project]

## Key Decisions
[List of key decisions made during the project]

## Open Questions
[List of open questions that need to be addressed]
```

### Usage Guidelines

- Update after significant progress or decisions
- Include rationale for key decisions
- Record blockers and their resolutions
- Keep summary of current state accurate

## Todo List (todo.md)

Tracks tasks and completion status.

### Template

```markdown
# Project Todo List

## Current Sprint
[List of tasks for the current sprint]

## Backlog
[List of tasks for future sprints]

## Completed Tasks
[List of completed tasks]
```

### Usage Guidelines

- Mark tasks using checkboxes: `[ ]` for pending, `[X]` for completed
- Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
- Prioritize tasks in the "Current Sprint" section
- Add any new requirements to the "Backlog" section
- Include sub-tasks with indentation where appropriate

## Maintenance Procedures

1. **Beginning of session**:
   - Review both context files to understand current state
   - Ask for updates if context appears outdated

2. **During session**:
   - Reference context when discussing tasks
   - Suggest changes to context files when new information emerges

3. **End of session**:
   - Update the memory file with new decisions or information
   - Update the todo list with new or completed tasks
   - Summarize changes made to context files
