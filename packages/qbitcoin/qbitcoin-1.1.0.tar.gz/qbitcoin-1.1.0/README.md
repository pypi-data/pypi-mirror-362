## Installation

## 1 using pip 

```bash
pip install qbitcoin
```
## then  run the smart installer 
install build dependcies
```bash
 sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake swig python3-dev libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libuv1-dev
```
after this  run smart installer 
```bash
python3 -m qbitcoin.smart_installer 
```
after installing type 'qbitcoin' in terminal to start node 


For mining 
 ```bash
qbitcoin --miningAddress <your qbitcoin address>
```

if you want to run directly 

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza1s34/Qbitcoin.git
cd Qbitcoin
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the node:

## Credits

This project is based on the [QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL) source code. We have modified and adapted the original QRL implementation to create Qbitcoin with enhanced features and improvements.

**Original Source Code:** [QRL - Quantum Resistant Ledger](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL.git)

We acknowledge and appreciate the foundational work done by the QRL development team in creating a quantum-resistant blockchain platform. This project builds upon their innovative approach to post-quantum cryptography in blockchain technology.
