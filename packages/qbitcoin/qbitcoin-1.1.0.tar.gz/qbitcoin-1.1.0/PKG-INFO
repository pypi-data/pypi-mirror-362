# Qbitcoin

A Python-based cryptocurrency implementation with quantum-resistant features.

## Features

- Quantum-resistant cryptography using Falcon signatures
- Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
- Multi-signature support
- Token transactions
- Web-based GUI interface
- gRPC API services
- Comprehensive testing suite

## Project Structure

- `qbitcoin/` - Core blockchain implementation
  - `core/` - Blockchain core components (blocks, transactions, miners)
  - `crypto/` - Cryptographic functions and quantum-resistant algorithms
  - `daemon/` - Wallet daemon services
  - `services/` - Network and API services
  - `generated/` - Protocol buffer generated files
- `gui/` - Web-based graphical user interface
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for various operations
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Installation

## 1 using pip 

```bash
pip install qbitcoin
```
## then  run the smart installer 
install build dependcies
```bash
 sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake swig python3-dev libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libuv1-dev
```
after this  run smart installer 
```bash
python3 -m qbitcoin.smart_installer 
```
after installing type 'qbitcoin' in terminal to start node 


For mining 
 ```bash
qbitcoin --miningAddress <your qbitcoin address>
```

if you want to run directly 

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza1s34/Qbitcoin.git
cd Qbitcoin
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the node:
```bash
python start_qbitcoin.py
```

## Usage

### GUI Mode
Launch the graphical interface:
```bash
python gui/qbitcoin_gui.py
```

### CLI Mode
Use the command-line interface:
```bash
python -m qbitcoin.cli
```

### Scripts
Various utility scripts are available in the `scripts/` directory for operations like:
- Creating transactions
- Token management
- Multi-signature operations
- Address debugging

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
## Note 
Please note that this project is in the final development phase, so some files and features may be incomplete. If you observe any issues, kindly provide feedback or open an issue on the repository. Your input is greatly appreciated!

## Credits

This project is based on the [QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL) source code. We have modified and adapted the original QRL implementation to create Qbitcoin with enhanced features and improvements.

**Original Source Code:** [QRL - Quantum Resistant Ledger](https://github.com/theQRL/QRL.git)

We acknowledge and appreciate the foundational work done by the QRL development team in creating a quantum-resistant blockchain platform. This project builds upon their innovative approach to post-quantum cryptography in blockchain technology.
