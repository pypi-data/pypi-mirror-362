    This function provides cross-platform temperature monitoring by detecting the operating system

    Returns:
        dict or None: Temperature data structure varies by platform:
        
        **macOS**: Dictionary with sensor names as keys and temperatures in Celsius as values

    Note:
        - Temperature readings may require elevated privileges on some systems

    Args:
