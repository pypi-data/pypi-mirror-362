# Accurate-Sqrt-Calculator (ASqrtC)
ASC was made to be a fast and accurate way of calculating square root.
It is 100% accurate and has no size limit.
Which means you could accurately calculate the square root of 2 to the thousandth digit.
Note: This project does NOT work with negative, imaginary, and complex numbers.
