VSPEC: Variable Star PhasE Curve
================================

VSPEC combines NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) with a custom stellar model
to produce phase curves of variable host + planet systems.

Documentation
-------------

VSPEC's documentation is hosted `here <https://vspec-collab.github.io/VSPEC>`_.
There you can find a description of the API as well as numerous examples.

How to Cite
-----------

A paper describing the code has been published in *Astronomy & Computing*. Please cite `this paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26C....5000890J/abstract>`_ if you use ``VSPEC``.

Additionally, the ``CITATION.cff`` file in this repository contains citation information for specific ``VSPEC`` versions.

Authors
-------

VSPEC was written by CRESST II post-baccs Cameron Kelahan and Ted Johnson with support
from many others. See Authors.md for more info.
