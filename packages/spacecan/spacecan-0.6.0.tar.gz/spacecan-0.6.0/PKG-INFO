# Python SpaceCAN, Version 0.6

SpaceCAN is an onboard system communication bus that is highly reliable.

Please refer to the official [SpaceCAN documentation](https://librecube.gitlab.io/standards/spacecan/).

## Installation

Install via pip:

```
pip install spacecan
```

## Examples

See the [examples folder](examples/) on how to create and operate a SpaceCAN network.

# Documentation

See the [docs folder](docs/) to learn more about the Python SpaceCAN implementation.

## Testing

The tests use virtual CAN network and thus cannot be run automatically by the GitLab pipeline. You
need to clone/download the repository and run the tests manually as such:

```
cd tests
source vcan.sh
pytest
```
