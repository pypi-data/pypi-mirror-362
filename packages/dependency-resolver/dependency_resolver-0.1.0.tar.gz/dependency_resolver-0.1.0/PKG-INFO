# dependency-resolver
Define external dependencies for a project using a JSON file and fetch and resolve them into the project.

Ideally for python versions > 3.11, but should be cope with 3.10, although different dependencies will be introduced (see requirements.txt)

For list of supported commands run dependency-resolver/resolve.py -h

Better notes will be added here in due course!
