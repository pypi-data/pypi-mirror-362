# Pythonic FP - Tools for iterables

PyPI project
[pythonic-fp.iterators](https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp.iterables/)
implementing a Python library of functions for iterables and iterators.

- Concatenating and merging iterables
- Dropping and taking values from iterables
- Reducing and accumulating iterables

#### Info:

This library assumes that at all times iterator protocol
is followed. This means that all iterators are iterable and
that ``iter(some_iterator) is some_iterator``.

#### Note:

Iterables are not necessarily iterators.

This PyPI project is part of of the grscheller
[pythonic-fp namespace projects](https://github.com/grscheller/pythonic-fp/blob/main/README.md).
