O,PART I
B1,ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
I1,
I1,"The Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement retailer and the"
I1,second largest retailer in the United States based on net sales volume for
I1,"fiscal 2000. At the end of our 2000 fiscal year, we were operating 1,103 Home"
I1,Depot(R) stores and 26 EXPO Design Center(R) stores. A description of these two
I1,types of stores is as follows:
I1,
I1,-        HOME DEPOT STORES: Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment
I1,of building materials and home improvement and lawn and
I1,garden products and provide a number of services. Home Depot
I1,"stores average approximately 108,000 square feet of enclosed"
I1,"space, with an additional approximately 24,000 square feet in"
I1,"the outside garden area. At fiscal year end, we had 1,096"
I1,Home Depot stores located throughout the United States and
I1,"Canada, as well as seven in South America."
I1,
I1,products and services primarily for design and renovation
I1,"projects. Unlike Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Center stores"
I1,"do not sell building materials and lumber. Rather, EXPO"
I1,"Design Center stores offer interior design products, such as"
I1,"kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, tiles, flooring and lighting"
I1,"fixtures, and installation services. The prototypical EXPO"
I1,"Design Center is approximately 100,000 square feet."
I1,
I1,"Additionally, at the end of fiscal 2000 we were operating four Villager's(R)"
I1,Hardware test stores in New Jersey. Villager's Hardware stores offer products
I1,for home enhancement and small projects. We also have one test store called The
I1,Home Depot Floor Store(SM) in Texas that sells only flooring products.
I1,
I1,We also offer products through two direct marketing subsidiaries. Our
I1,Maintenance Warehouse(R) subsidiary is a leading direct mail marketer of
I1,"maintenance, repair and operations products serving primarily the multi-family"
I1,housing and lodging facilities management market. The company fills orders
I1,"through its 19 distribution centers, which are located throughout the United"
I1,"States. During fiscal 2000, Maintenance Warehouse expanded its operations in"
I1,"Texas, Arizona and Georgia through the acquisition of N-E Thing Supply Company,"
I1,"Inc. National Blinds & Wallpaper(SM), a wholly owned subsidiary, is a telephone"
I1,mail order service for wallpaper and custom window treatments.
I1,
I1,"We also operate two wholly owned subsidiaries, Georgia Lighting, Inc. and Apex"
I1,"Supply Company, Inc. Georgia Lighting(R), a leading specialty lighting"
I1,"designer, distributor and retailer, has six retail locations in Georgia. Apex"
I1,"Supply Company is a wholesale supplier of plumbing, HVAC, appliances and other"
I1,"related professional products with 22 locations in Georgia, Tennessee and South"
I1,Carolina.
I1,
I1,Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry
I1,"Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339-4024. The telephone number is (770) 433-8211."
I1,
I1,RETAIL BUSINESSES
I1,
I1,HOME DEPOT STORES
I1,
I1,OPERATING STRATEGY. The operating strategy for Home Depot stores is to offer a
I1,broad assortment of high-quality merchandise and services at competitive prices
I1,"using highly knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and aggressive"
I1,advertising. We believe that our associates' knowledge of products and home
I1,improvement techniques and applications is very important in our marketing
I1,approach and our ability to maintain customer satisfaction. We regularly check
I1,our competitors' prices to ensure that our prices are competitive within each
I1,market.
I1,
I1,CUSTOMERS. Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups:
I1,
I1,typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their
I1,own projects and installations. To complement the in-store
I1,"expertise of our associates, Home Depot stores offer many"
I1,"D-I-Y ""how-to"" clinics taught by associates and merchandise"
I1,vendors.
I1,
I1,typically homeowners who purchase materials themselves and
I1,hire third parties to complete the project and/or
I1,installation. We offer B-I-Y customers installation services
I1,for a variety of products through third party contractors.
I1,
I1,-        PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS: These customers are professional
I1,"repair remodelers, general contractors and tradesmen. In many"
I1,stores we offer a variety of programs to these professional
I1,"customers, including additional delivery and will-call"
I1,services; dedicated staff; extensive merchandise selections;
I1,"and expanded credit programs, all of which we believe"
I1,increase sales.
I1,
I1,"PRODUCTS. A typical Home Depot store stocks approximately 40,000 to 50,000"
I1,"product items, including variations in color and size. Each store carries a"
I1,wide selection of high-quality and nationally advertised brand name
I1,merchandise. The following table shows the percentage of sales of each major
I1,product group for each of the last three fiscal years:

I1,

X,
I1,We buy our store merchandise from vendors located throughout the world. No
I1,"single vendor accounts for more than six percent of our total purchases, and we"
I1,are not dependent on any single vendor. Most of our merchandise is purchased
I1,"directly from manufacturers, which eliminates ""middleman"" costs. We believe"
I1,that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all
I1,of the products we sell in Home Depot stores.
I1,
I1,We maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality
I1,"products directly from overseas manufacturers, which gives our customers a"
I1,broader selection of products and better values while enhancing our gross
I1,margin. Our product development managers travel internationally to identify
I1,opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores. This enables us to
I1,"improve product quality, to import products not currently available to our"
I1,customers and to offer at a lower price products that would otherwise be
I1,purchased from third party importers. We currently source products from more
I1,than 260 manufacturers in approximately 35 countries.
I1,
I1,"To complement the established national brand name products we offer, we have"
I1,formed strategic alliances with vendor partners to market products under brand
I1,names that are only offered through The Home Depot. At the end of fiscal year
I1,"2000, we offered products under more than 30 proprietary and other exclusive"
I1,"brands, including Thomasville(TM) kitchen and bathroom cabinets; RIDGID(R)"
I1,power tools; Behr Premium Plus(R) paint; Mill's Pride(R) cabinets; GE
I1,"SmartWater(TM) water heaters; and Vigoro(R) fertilizer. In the future, we may"
I1,consider additional strategic alignments with other vendors to offer products
I1,"under proprietary brand names. Additionally, we will continue to assess"
I1,opportunities to expand the range of products available under existing
I1,proprietary brands.
I1,
I1,INSTALLED SALES SERVICES. Home Depot stores offer a variety of installed sales
I1,programs through its At-Home Services business. This service targets the B-I-Y
I1,customer who will select and purchase materials for a project and prefers the
I1,Company to provide professional installation. We implement our installed sales
I1,"programs through approximately 6,800 independent qualified contractors in the"
I1,"U.S. and Canada. These programs include the installation of carpeting, hard"
I1,"flooring, cabinets, solid surface countertops, exterior doors, garage doors,"
I1,"roofing, siding and windows. During fiscal 2000, we also began testing a"
I1,residential HVAC program in Tennessee and Georgia and plan to expand the
I1,offering during fiscal 2001.
I1,
I1,IN-STORE INITIATIVES. We continually assess our business to find opportunities
I1,"to increase customer loyalty, thereby increasing sales. Accordingly, we"
I1,implemented or expanded a number of in-store initiatives in Home Depot stores
I1,"during fiscal 2000, including:"
I1,
I1,-        Professional Business Customer Initiative. We are committed
I1,to being the supplier of choice to a variety of professional
I1,"customers, including certain repair remodelers, carpenters,"
I1,"plumbers, painters, electricians, building maintenance"
I1,"professionals and designers. During fiscal 2000, we continued"
I1,to expand an initiative that adds service-related programs to
I1,our stores that are designed to increase sales to
I1,professional customers. Stores participating in the program
I1,add associates at a sales desk dedicated to providing more
I1,"personalized service to professional customers, including"
I1,managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pick-up
I1,"or same-day delivery. Additionally, during the hours when"
I1,"professionals typically shop, these stores assign sales"
I1,associates in certain departments to assist these customers.
I1,"To better serve our professional customers, we also increase"
I1,quantities of existing products typically purchased by
I1,
I1,professionals in bulk quantities and offer certain items in
I1,each department packaged in bulk to offer additional savings.
I1,"While aimed at the professional customer, this program also"
I1,enables us to better serve our D-I-Y customer with improved
I1,"customer service, including delivery and will-call services,"
I1,expanded credit programs and additional merchandise. Through
I1,"this initiative, we have identified best practices in serving"
I1,our professional customers that are being implemented in many
I1,of our stores without material additional costs. By the end
I1,"of fiscal 2000, we had expanded the professional customer"
I1,initiative into 29 markets with approximately 165 stores. We
I1,"anticipate that during fiscal year 2001, we will expand this"
I1,initiative to approximately 335 additional stores.
I1,
I1,-        SPI Initiative. We began testing the Service Performance
I1,"Improvement, or ""SPI,"" initiative during fiscal 2000 in"
I1,approximately 51 stores in three markets. The program focuses
I1,on making it easier to shop in our stores while emphasizing
I1,safety and improving customer service. Stores that have
I1,implemented the initiative assign some associates specific
I1,tasks while others focus on assisting customers.
I1,"Additionally, these stores schedule associates to receive"
I1,shipments and stock merchandise when our stores are closed or
I1,during hours when they have fewer customers. We believe this
I1,separation of assignments will allow us to provide better
I1,"customer service while improving labor productivity, managing"
I1,inventory more efficiently and increasing sales. We currently
I1,anticipate rolling this program out to most of our stores
I1,during fiscal 2001.
I1,
I1,"-        Appliance Sales. During fiscal 2000, we completed the"
I1,roll-out of our appliance sales program to most of our stores
I1,in the U.S. Through this program we sell appliances
I1,"manufactured by General Electric(R), Maytag(R) and other"
I1,manufacturers. We display and stock the more popular
I1,appliances in our stores and offer the ability to special
I1,"order over 2,000 additional products through computer kiosks"
I1,located in the store. Through the computer kiosks we can
I1,check inventory and arrange for delivery to the customer
I1,directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the
I1,"order is placed. During fiscal 2001, we plan to expand the"
I1,appliances we sell and to continue to test new formats for
I1,selling appliances.
I1,
I1,-        Tool Rental. As part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range
I1,of the needs of our professional customers and our D-I-Y
I1,"customers, we offer a tool rental service in certain stores."
I1,"Under this program, we rent approximately 200"
I1,"commercial-quality tools in ten categories, including saws,"
I1,"floor sanders, generators, gas powered lawn equipment and"
I1,"plumbing tools. Customers can lease the tools on an hourly,"
I1,"daily, weekly or monthly basis. Our associates who work in"
I1,the tool rental area receive special training concerning the
I1,"use and maintenance of the tools. As of January 28, 2001, we"
I1,offered tool rental service in approximately 342 stores
I1,compared to 150 stores at the end of fiscal 1999. During
I1,"fiscal 2001, we anticipate expanding tool rental services"
I1,"into additional stores, and we believe that ultimately tool"
I1,rental centers will be in approximately 60% of our stores. We
I1,believe that offering this service increases the sales of
I1,related merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment
I1,similar to that available for rental.
I1,
I1,"-        Special Order Center Test. Currently, the special order"
I1,center processes water heater orders nationwide through a
I1,toll-free number and special order blinds and wallpaper
I1,through a separate toll-free number that is available to
I1,approximately 95 stores in three markets. Stores currently
I1,participating in the program have experienced increased water
I1,heater sales and reductions in customer transaction times for
I1,placing orders for blinds and wallpaper.
I1,
I1,-        Customer Education Programs. We offer several programs to
I1,enhance the skills and confidence of our D-I-Y customers. Our
I1,"associates and vendors teach ""how-to"" clinics that focus on"
I1,"D-I-Y projects, such as installing garbage disposals, laying"
I1,"patio pavers or building a deck. In addition to the clinics,"
I1,"we offer Home Depot University(SM), which presents four-week"
I1,modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets
I1,"of a home improvement topic. For example, a room enhancement"
I1,"module may provide instruction on paint, wallpaper and window"
I1,treatments. Through The Home Depot's Kids Workshop(SM)
I1,"program, children are instructed in tool safety and complete a"
I1,"small project, such as building a birdhouse or tool box. We"
I1,believe that these types of educational programs increase our
I1,"sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects,"
I1,differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our
I1,position as experts in home improvement.
I1,
I1,STORE GROWTH
I1,
I1,"United States. At the end of fiscal 2000, we were operating 1,029 Home Depot"
I1,"stores in the United States, including Puerto Rico. During fiscal 2000 in the"
I1,"U.S., we opened 173 new Home Depot stores and relocated eight existing Home"
I1,Depot stores. Although these new store openings occurred primarily in existing
I1,"markets, we continued our geographic expansion by opening stores in a number of"
I1,new markets. We currently anticipate opening approximately 200 new stores and
I1,relocating nine existing stores during fiscal 2001.
I1,
I1,"To increase customer service levels, gain incremental sales and enhance"
I1,"long-term market penetration, we often open new stores near the edge of the"
I1,market areas served by existing stores. While these openings may initially have
I1,"a negative impact on comparable store-for-store sales, we believe this"
I1,"""cannibalization"" strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market"
I1,"share by reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing"
I1,customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations. During
I1,"fiscal 2000, approximately 30% of our stores were cannibalized by new store"
I1,openings.
I1,
I1,"Canada. At the end of fiscal 2000, we were operating 67 Home Depot stores in"
I1,"seven Canadian provinces. Of these stores, 14 were opened during fiscal 2000,"
I1,"including our first stores in Quebec and Nova Scotia. During fiscal 2001, we"
I1,plan to open approximately 13 additional stores in Canada. Our Canadian stores
I1,are operated through a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of The Home Depot.
I1,
I1,"South America. At the end of fiscal 2000, we were operating seven Home Depot"
I1,"stores in Chile and Argentina, and we anticipate opening additional stores in"
I1,South America during fiscal 2001. We operate our Chilean Home Depot stores
I1,"through a joint venture with S.A.C.I. Falabella, a leading department store"
I1,retailer in Chile. Our controlling share of the joint venture is 66.67%.
I1,
I1,Our Argentina stores are operated through a wholly owned Argentine subsidiary.
I1,We have offices in both Argentina and Chile from which day-to-day operations
I1,are handled by a management team comprised of local nationals and seasoned U.S.
I1,Home Depot managers.
I1,
I1,EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES
I1,
I1,OPERATING STRATEGY. The operating strategy for our EXPO Design Center stores is
I1,"to offer complete interior design services, high-quality, competitively priced"
I1,products and installation services to assist our customers in their home decor
I1,and remodeling projects. Each EXPO Design Center store features up to eight
I1,"different showrooms, each with full-size displays to help customers visualize"
I1,"the end result of possible interior design projects. To assist our customers,"
I1,we employ associates who provide exceptional customer service and who have
I1,"expertise in designing, planning and completing projects."
I1,
I1,"CUSTOMERS. Typically, customers at EXPO Design Center stores are middle to"
I1,"upper income B-I-Y customers, who purchase merchandise for installation by"
I1,"others. Accordingly, we offer installation services for most of the products we"
I1,sell at these stores.
I1,
I1,PRODUCTS. EXPO Design Center stores offer interior design products and
I1,installation services in the following core product categories:
I1,
I1,EXPO Design Center stores offer a broad range of merchandise in an effort to
I1,meet all the needs of shoppers whose interior design preferences may go beyond
I1,the items available in a Home Depot store. While there is minimal overlap
I1,between the products offered in Home Depot stores and EXPO Design Center
I1,"stores, those products available at EXPO Design Center stores are typically"
I1,higher-end or more unique items. In addition to nationally advertised brand
I1,"name products, we also offer items that must be special ordered or that are"
I1,typically offered through showrooms open only to design professionals.
I1,
I1,"STORE GROWTH. At the end of fiscal 2000, we were operating 26 EXPO Design"
I1,"Center stores, eleven of which were opened that year. We currently anticipate"
I1,opening 17 additional stores in fiscal 2001. These new stores are expected to
I1,"average approximately 100,000 square feet and will incorporate a showroom"
I1,environment.
I1,
I1,IN-STORE SERVICES. We have associates at our EXPO Design Center stores to
I1,assist with every phase of a project. Certified kitchen and bath designers are
I1,on staff. We also have design professionals to help our customers design
I1,"lighting, tile and flooring, custom upholstery and bedding, custom closets and"
I1,window treatments. Installation services are available for most
I1,
I1,"products at EXPO Design Center stores, including kitchens, baths, flooring,"
I1,"wallpaper, tile, lighting fixtures and window treatments. Our project managers"
I1,ensure that the products are available and then schedule licensed third party
I1,contractors to complete the work. We warrant the workmanship of each
I1,installation for as long as the customer owns the home.
I1,
I1,GEORGIA LIGHTING
I1,
I1,We acquired our wholly owned subsidiary Georgia Lighting in June 1999. Georgia
I1,"Lighting is a leading specialty lighting designer, distributor and retailer"
I1,"based in Atlanta. The company, which has six retail locations, offers an"
I1,"extensive collection of decorative lighting fixtures, supplies, accents and"
I1,accessories to commercial and retail customers. We believe that the acquisition
I1,"of Georgia Lighting has allowed us to strengthen our sourcing, training and"
I1,merchandising in lighting for both The Home Depot and EXPO Design Center
I1,stores.
I1,
I1,APEX SUPPLY COMPANY
I1,
I1,"In January 2000, we acquired Apex Supply Company, a wholesale distributor of"
I1,"plumbing, HVAC, appliances and other related products. The Company offers these"
I1,"products through 22 locations in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina and"
I1,employs approximately 570 associates. Apex assisted us with the development of
I1,"our HVAC program, and we believe this acquisition will help us to increase our"
I1,penetration of the professional plumbing trades and to be able to handle
I1,special orders for plumbing products more efficiently in Home Depot stores.
I1,
I1,VILLAGER'S HARDWARE STORES
I1,
I1,"During fiscal 1999, we opened the first two Villager's Hardware test stores,"
I1,"and in fiscal 2000 we opened an additional two stores, all of which are in New"
I1,"Jersey. These stores stock approximately 40,000 items, including variations in"
I1,"color and size, including hardware, fasteners, tools, plumbing, electrical and"
I1,"seasonal, as well as a broad selection of home enhancement products, including"
I1,"paint and wallpaper, window treatments, lighting, storage, housewares and"
I1,giftware. We believe that the primary focus for these stores will be home
I1,enhancement and small projects. Each Villager's Hardware store has
I1,"approximately 35,000 to 40,000 square feet of selling space in a retail"
I1,"environment, emphasizing customer service and education. During fiscal 2001, we"
I1,will continue to analyze the results of this test.
I1,
I1,THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE
I1,
I1,"During fiscal 2000, we opened a test store in Plano, Texas that offers flooring"
I1,"products. The Floor Store's merchandise assortment includes carpet, ceramic,"
I1,"wood, laminate and vinyl flooring. During fiscal 2001, we will continue to"
I1,analyze the results of this test.
I1,
I1,INTERNET
I1,
I1,Our website is located at www.homedepot.com. The site offers information about
I1,"projects and our products, calculators to estimate the amount and kinds of"
I1,"materials needed to complete a project, as well as information about our"
I1,"company. As with our stores, the focus of our website is customer service. We"
I1,believe our Internet site provides us with an opportunity to build
I1,
I1,"relationships with our customers, educate our customers, improve service and"
I1,increase incremental store sales.
I1,
I1,"During fiscal 2000, we began selling Home Depot products over the Internet in"
I1,three markets. We offer customers the products available at stores in their
I1,"local market on our website, and the products are priced based on the market in"
I1,"which the customer lives. Orders are fulfilled from our stores, and customers"
I1,can either pick up their purchases or have them delivered. By integrating
I1,"Internet purchases with our stores, we hope to provide our customers with"
I1,"greater flexibility and service. During fiscal 2001, we have begun to offer"
I1,products that can be shipped by United Parcel Service for sale through the
I1,Internet in additional areas of the U.S.
I1,
I1,DIRECT MARKETING SALES
I1,
I1,We have two subsidiaries that sell merchandise through direct marketing:
I1,
I1,-        MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE. Our Maintenance Warehouse subsidiary is a
I1,"leading provider of maintenance, repair and operations products"
I1,primarily to the multi-family housing and lodging facilities
I1,"management market. Through its catalog, which is published"
I1,"semi-annually, Maintenance Warehouse offers approximately 16,000"
I1,"items, including variations in color and size. Maintenance Warehouse,"
I1,"which employs approximately 1,100 people, emphasizes accurate order"
I1,"taking, delivery and personalized service. Orders are typically placed"
I1,"over the telephone, through a field sales representative or through"
I1,"the company's website at www.mwh.com, are filled through one of"
I1,Maintenance Warehouses' 19 distribution centers and are shipped for
I1,"same-day or next-day delivery. During fiscal 2000, Maintenance"
I1,"Warehouse expanded its operations in Texas, Arkansas and Georgia"
I1,"through the acquisition of N-E Thing Supply Company, Inc."
I1,
I1,products through telephone sales and over the Internet. The company
I1,markets primarily through magazine advertising aimed at customers
I1,"seeking the lowest prices. The company maintains no inventory, but"
I1,rather acts as a broker to fill special order sales.
I1,
I1,STORE SUPPORT SERVICES
I1,
I1,"Hardware store is equipped with a computerized point of sale system, electronic"
I1,bar code scanning system and a UNIX server. Store information is communicated
I1,to the Store Support Center's computers via a land-based Asynchronous Transfer
I1,"Mode (""ATM"") network in the U.S. and a frame relay network internationally."
I1,"These computers provide corporate, financial, merchandising and other back"
I1,office function support. We believe our systems provide efficient customer
I1,"check-out and returns, store-based inventory management, rapid order"
I1,"replenishment, labor planning support and item movement information. Fast"
I1,"registers, credit authorizations and check approvals expedite transactions in"
I1,our stores at a pace that we believe sets the standard for our industry. For
I1,"example, to better serve the increasing number of customers applying for credit"
I1,"while in our stores, the charge card approval process time has been reduced to"
I1,less than 30 seconds.
I1,
I1,We have implemented a mobile ordering system in our Home Depot stores using
I1,portable carts with
I1,
I1,computers to assist our associates in placing accurate orders for inventory.
I1,"Through the system, an associate on the sales floor can see the supply the"
I1,"store has for a given item, review the suggested re-order quantities based on"
I1,the store's historical experience and place an order with the vendor. We
I1,believe the system increases the efficiency and productivity of our associates
I1,because it requires less time and fewer people to assess and order inventory.
I1,We have also implemented a mobile signing system to help ensure that our
I1,"signing is consistent with our point-of-sale price data. Additionally, we are"
I1,in the process of rolling out additional systems tools to assist with labor
I1,scheduling to help ensure the best possible customer service levels.
I1,
I1,We are continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems to support
I1,"growth, reduce and control costs and enable our associates to make better"
I1,decisions. We continue to realize greater efficiency as a result of our
I1,"electronic data interchange (""EDI"") program. Currently, most of our high volume"
I1,"vendors are participating in the EDI program, which represents more than 70% of"
I1,"our total transactional volume. EDI is a paperless system, which processes"
I1,"orders from buying offices to vendors, alerts the stores when the merchandise"
I1,is to arrive and transmits invoice data from the vendors and freight carriers
I1,to the Store Support Center.
I1,
I1,"ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT. As of January 28, 2001, we employed approximately"
I1,"227,000 associates, of whom approximately 12,800 were salaried, with the"
I1,remainder compensated on an hourly basis. Approximately 74% of our associates
I1,"are employed on a full-time basis. To attract and retain qualified personnel,"
I1,we seek to maintain salary and wage levels equal to or above those of our
I1,competitors in each market area. Store managers have access to information
I1,regarding competitive salary rates in their respective markets.
I1,
I1,We develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of
I1,our associates. These programs are designed to increase associates' knowledge
I1,"of merchandising departments and products, including mandatory product"
I1,"knowledge training classes, and to educate, develop and test the skills of"
I1,those associates who are interested in being promoted. Because our policy is to
I1,promote or relocate current associates to serve as managers and assistant
I1,"managers for new stores, training and assessment of our associates is essential"
I1,to our growth. Our district managers and store managers typically meet with our
I1,human resources associates to discuss the development of assistant managers and
I1,certain department heads and consider possible candidates for promotion.
I1,
I1,We have implemented programs in our stores to ensure that we hire and promote
I1,the best qualified associates in a non-discriminatory way. These programs
I1,"integrate validated computerized tests for all applicants, as well as"
I1,specialized tests for certain positions. If an applicant passes the computer
I1,"test, he or she may be selected for a structured interview in which questions"
I1,to be asked are selected by the computer based on the answers given on the
I1,original computer test. We also maintain a list of qualified associates who are
I1,interested in a new assignment and of qualified outside applicants that can be
I1,reviewed when positions become available.
I1,
I1,"We have never experienced a strike or any work stoppage, and we believe that"
I1,our employee relations are good. There are no collective bargaining agreements
I1,covering any of our associates.
I1,
I1,"MARKETING. We are one of the nation's largest retail advertisers, and we"
I1,utilize all forms of mass media and selected forms of highly targeted media. We
I1,"also incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan, such as NASCAR(R),"
I1,"the Olympic games, CBS College Football and home and garden shows. We extend"
I1,"our reach and educate our customers through proprietary publications,"
I1,
I1,such as the Home Improvement 1-2-3(TM) series and the Style Ideas magazine.
I1,
I1,We execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis. Because
I1,the vast majority of our stores are located throughout the United States and
I1,"Canada, we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers by using"
I1,"national advertising. At the same time, we tailor the majority of our"
I1,"advertising locally to respond to market differences, both in terms of products"
I1,and the competitive environment.
I1,
I1,CREDIT SERVICES. Home Depot offers credit purchase programs to both
I1,"professional and D-I-Y and B-I-Y customers. In fiscal 2000, 2.6 million new"
I1,"Home Depot credit accounts were opened, bringing the total number of Home Depot"
I1,account holders to almost 8 million. Proprietary credit card sales accounted
I1,for approximately 19% of all Home Depot sales in fiscal 2000. During fiscal
I1,"2000, we rolled-out a program to all U.S. stores that gives our customers the"
I1,opportunity to apply for unsecured Home Improvement Loans to purchase products
I1,and services in our stores. We believe that this loan program not only
I1,"increases large sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also generates"
I1,incremental sales from our customers.
I1,
I1,"have registered or applied for registration of a variety of trade names,"
I1,"service marks, trademarks and copyrights for use in our business, including The"
I1,"Home Depot(R), the ""Homer"" (R) character, EXPO Design Center(R) stores, Hampton"
I1,"Bay(R) fans, lighting and accessories and PremiumCut(TM) lumber. We regard our"
I1,intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important
I1,factor in the marketing of the Company and our stores and direct marketing
I1,efforts. We are not aware of any facts that could be expected to negatively
I1,impact our intellectual property.
I1,
I1,QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. For our globally sourced products that we directly
I1,"import, we have implemented a quality assurance program. Through this program,"
I1,"we have established criteria for both vendor/factory and product performance,"
I1,"which measure factors including product quality, timely shipments and fill"
I1,rate. The performance record is monitored relative to our requirements and is
I1,also made available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement.
I1,"This quality assurance program, which is applied to products directly imported"
I1,"by Home Depot, has four components:"
I1,
I1,-        we authorize laboratories to test products prior to purchase
I1,to ensure compliance with requirements;
I1,
I1,"-        we develop and document product requirements, based on test"
I1,"results, applicable national and international standards and"
I1,features determined by our merchants;
I1,
I1,-        we assess the capability of factories to manufacture quality
I1,"products that meet the expectations we have developed, as"
I1,well as to assess their compliance with Home Depot policies
I1,on child labor; and
I1,
I1,-        we routinely assess product quality and factory performance
I1,by conducting inspections at the factory on shipments to
I1,"assure continued compliance with our product requirements,"
I1,and we reserve the right to perform random audits on child
I1,labor policies.
I1,
I1,LOGISTICS. We use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase
I1,our efficiencies. A large percentage of our merchandise is shipped directly
I1,from our vendors to the stores. We operate a number of facilities to distribute
I1,"the remaining merchandise to our stores. For example, certain import products"
I1,"require the use of distribution centers. Accordingly, we have seven import"
I1,"distribution centers, located in the United States, Canada, Argentina and"
I1,"Chile. Additionally, at the end of fiscal 2000, we had 27 lumber distribution"
I1,facilities in the United States and Canada to support the lumber demands of our
I1,"stores. We also operated one cross-docking transit facility, and we currently"
I1,plan to add several additional facilities during fiscal 2001. At these
I1,"facilities, we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately load it"
I1,onto trucks for delivery to our stores. We continually assess opportunities to
I1,improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs of our stores and
I1,to lower costs.
I1,
I1,SAFETY. We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers
I1,and associates. The Safety Department consists of a team of directors and
I1,"managers in the field focused primarily on education and training, as well as"
I1,an Atlanta-based team of dedicated safety resources who evaluate and implement
I1,policies and processes Company-wide. The goal of the Safety Department is to
I1,implement a safety program designed to engineer safety into the fabric of our
I1,"Company, establishing a ""safety first"" approach to all facets of our business."
I1,"Our Safety Department is responsible for managing the Company's safety program,"
I1,"which is implemented in conjunction with store-level associates, store and"
I1,"Division management, and the Human Resources and Merchandising Departments. The"
I1,primary focuses of our safety program are (1) to establish safety standards and
I1,"processes for all aspects of store operations and merchandising, (2) to"
I1,"effectively train appropriate associates on all applicable standards, and (3)"
I1,to monitor compliance with established safety standards.
I1,
I1,"COMPETITION. Our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store"
I1,"location, customer service and depth of merchandise. In each of the markets we"
I1,"serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical,"
I1,plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to
I1,"some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and"
I1,"national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent"
I1,"building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. In addition to"
I1,"these entities, our EXPO Design Center stores also compete with specialty"
I1,"design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design"
I1,professionals.
I1,
I1,"Due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure"
I1,our market share in existing market areas. We believe that we are an effective
I1,"and significant competitor in our markets. Based on U.S. Census data estimates,"
I1,internal estimates and data provided by the Home Improvement Research
I1,"Institute, we believe that our market share in the U.S. and Canada, currently"
I1,"defined as including the Do-It-Yourself/Buy-It-Yourself, Tradesmen,"
I1,"Builders/General Contractors, Heavy Industrial, Repair and Remodeling and"
I1,"Property Maintenance markets, is approximately 9.4%."
I1,

I2,
I2,"Of our 1,134 Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Center stores, Villager's Hardware"
I2,"stores and The Floor Store at January 28, 2001, approximately 78% were owned"
I2,(including those owned subject to a ground lease) consisting of approximately
I2,"95,667,000 square feet and approximately 22% were leased consisting of"
I2,"approximately 27,097,000 square feet. In recent years, we have increased the"
I2,relative percentage of new stores that are owned. Although we take advantage of
I2,"lease financing opportunities, we generally prefer to own stores because of"
I2,"greater operating control and flexibility, generally lower occupancy costs and"
I2,certain other economic advantages.
I2,
I2,"Our executive, corporate staff and financial offices occupy approximately"
I2,"1,665,000 square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. In"

I7,RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
I7,
I7,For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the Company's
I7,"performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should"
I7,be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes
I7,to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report.
I7,
I7,Net sales for fiscal 2000 increased 19.0% to $45.7 billion from $38.4 billion
I7,"in fiscal 1999. This increase was attributable to, among other things, full"
I7,"year sales from the 169 new stores opened during fiscal 1999, a 4% comparable"
I7,store-for-store sales increase and 204 new store openings.
I7,
I7,Gross profit as a percent of sales was 29.9% for fiscal 2000 compared to 29.7%
I7,for fiscal 1999. The rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost
I7,"of merchandise resulting from product line reviews, benefits from global"
I7,sourcing programs and an increase in the number of tool rental centers from 150
I7,at the end of fiscal 1999 to 342 at the end of fiscal 2000.
I7,
I7,Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 20.7% for fiscal 2000 compared to
I7,19.8% for fiscal 1999. Selling and store operating expenses as a percent of
I7,sales increased to 18.6% in fiscal 2000 from 17.8% in fiscal 1999. The increase
I7,was primarily attributable to higher store selling payroll expenses resulting
I7,"from market wage pressures and an increase in employee longevity. In addition,"
I7,medical costs increased due to higher family enrollment in the Company's
I7,"medical plans, rising health care costs and higher prescription drug costs."
I7,"Finally, store occupancy costs, such as property taxes, property rent,"
I7,"depreciation and utilities, increased due to new store growth and energy rate"
I7,increases.
I7,
I7,Pre-opening expenses as a percent of sales were 0.3% for both fiscal 2000 and
I7,"1999. The Company opened 204 new stores and relocated 8 stores in fiscal 2000,"
I7,compared to opening 169 new stores and relocating 6 stores in fiscal 1999.
I7,"Pre-opening expenses averaged $671,000 per store in fiscal 2000 compared to"
I7,"$643,000 per store in fiscal 1999. The higher average expense was primarily due"
I7,to the opening of more EXPO Design Center stores and expansion of Home Depot
I7,"stores into certain new markets including international locations, which"
I7,"involved longer pre-opening periods and higher training, travel and relocation"
I7,costs.
I7,
I7,General and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 1.8% for fiscal
I7,2000 compared to 1.7% for fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to
I7,"investments in Internet development and international operations, as well as a"
I7,full year of payroll and other costs associated with operating four new
I7,"divisional offices, which opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999."
I7,
I7,Interest and investment income as a percent of sales was 0.1% for both fiscal
I7,2000 and 1999. Interest expense as a percent of sales was 0.1% for both
I7,comparable periods.
I7,
I7,The Company's combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to
I7,38.8% for fiscal 2000 from 39.0% for fiscal 1999. The decrease was attributable
I7,to higher tax credits in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999.
I7,
I7,Net earnings as a percent of sales were 5.6% for fiscal 2000 compared to 6.0%
I7,"for fiscal 1999, reflecting higher selling and store operating expenses as a"
I7,percent of sales partially offset by a higher gross profit rate as described
I7,above. Diluted earnings per share were $1.10 for fiscal 2000 compared to $1.00
I7,for fiscal 1999.
I7,
I7,Net sales for fiscal 1999 increased 27.2% to $38.4 billion from $30.2 billion
I7,"in fiscal 1998. This increase was attributable to, among other things, full"
I7,"year sales from the 138 new stores opened during fiscal 1998, a 10% comparable"
I7,"store-for-store sales increase, and 169 new store openings and 6 store"
I7,relocations during fiscal 1999.
I7,
I7,Gross profit as a percent of sales was 29.7% for fiscal 1999 compared to 28.5%
I7,for fiscal 1998. The rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost
I7,of merchandise resulting from product line reviews and increased sales of
I7,"imported products, and other merchandising initiatives begun in prior years and"
I7,"continued during fiscal 1999, as well as to sales mix shifts to higher gross"
I7,"margin product categories and assortments. In addition, inventory and refund"
I7,
I7,systems improvements and more effective training resulted in better inventory
I7,shrink results and lower product markdowns.
I7,
I7,Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 19.8% for fiscal 1999 compared to
I7,19.7% for fiscal 1998. Selling and store operating expenses as a percent of
I7,sales increased to 17.8% in fiscal 1999 from 17.7% in fiscal 1998. The increase
I7,was primarily attributable to higher store selling payroll expenses resulting
I7,"from market wage pressures and an increase in employee longevity, as well as by"
I7,the Company's continued investment in new customer service initiatives. In
I7,"addition, medical costs increased due to higher family enrollment in the"
I7,"Company's medical plans, increased claims and higher prescription drug costs."
I7,The Company's strong financial performance during fiscal 1999 also resulted in
I7,higher bonus expenses as a percent of sales. Credit card discounts increased as
I7,a result of higher penetrations of credit card sales and increases in
I7,non-private label discount rates. Partially offsetting these increases were
I7,lower net advertising expenses resulting from higher cooperative advertising
I7,participation by vendors and economies realized from the increased use of
I7,national advertising.
I7,
I7,Pre-opening expenses as a percent of sales were 0.3% for both fiscal 1999 and
I7,"1998. The Company opened 169 new stores and relocated 6 stores in fiscal 1999,"
I7,compared to 138 new stores and 4 store relocations in fiscal 1998. Pre-opening
I7,"expenses averaged $643,000 per store in fiscal 1999 compared to $618,000 per"
I7,store in fiscal 1998. The higher average expense was primarily due to the
I7,opening of more EXPO Design Center stores and expansion of Home Depot stores
I7,"into certain new markets, which involved longer pre-opening periods and higher"
I7,"training, travel and relocation costs."
I7,
I7,General and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 1.7% for both
I7,fiscal 1999 and 1998. Incremental expenses related to long-term growth and
I7,"business planning initiatives, including Internet development, international"
I7,operations and the opening of four new divisional offices during the fourth
I7,"quarter of fiscal 1999, were offset by efficiencies realized from increased"
I7,sales.
I7,
I7,Interest and investment income as a percent of sales was 0.1% for both fiscal
I7,1999 and 1998. Interest expense as a percent of sales was 0.1% for both
I7,comparable periods.
I7,
I7,The Company's combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to
I7,39.0% for fiscal 1999 from 39.2% for fiscal 1998. The decrease was attributable
I7,to higher tax credits in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998.
I7,
I7,Net earnings as a percent of sales were 6.0% for fiscal 1999 compared to 5.3%
I7,"for fiscal 1998, reflecting a higher gross profit rate partially offset by"
I7,higher operating expenses as a percent of sales as described above. Diluted
I7,earnings per share were $1.00 for fiscal 1999 compared to $0.71 for fiscal
I7,1998.
I7,
I7,Cash flow generated from store operations provides the Company with a
I7,"significant source of liquidity. Additionally, a portion of the Company's"
I7,inventory is financed under vendor credit terms.
I7,
I7,The Company currently plans to open approximately 200 new stores and relocate 9
I7,existing stores during fiscal 2001. It is anticipated that approximately 92% of
I7,"these locations will be owned, and the remainder will be leased."
I7,
I7,The Company has two operating lease agreements totaling $882 million for the
I7,purpose of financing construction costs of certain new stores. Under the
I7,"operating lease agreements, the lessor purchases the properties, pays for the"
I7,construction costs and subsequently leases the facilities to the Company. The
I7,leases provide for substantial residual value guarantees and include purchase
I7,options at original cost on each property. The Company financed a portion of
I7,"its new stores opened from fiscal 1997 through fiscal 2000, as well as office"
I7,"buildings in fiscal 1999 and 2000, under the operating lease agreements."
I7,
I7,The cost of new stores to be constructed and owned by the Company varies
I7,"widely, principally due to land costs, and is currently estimated to average"
I7,approximately $14.1 million per location. The cost to remodel and/or fixture
I7,stores to be leased is expected to average approximately $4.9 million per
I7,"store. In addition, each new store will require approximately $3.5 million to"
I7,"finance inventories, net of vendor financing."
I7,
I7,"During fiscal 1999, the Company issued $500 million of 6 1/2% Senior Notes"
I7,"(""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes are due on September 15, 2004 and pay"
I7,interest semi-annually. The Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any
I7,"time, in whole or in part, at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest"
I7,up to the redemption date. The net proceeds from the offering were used to
I7,"finance a portion of the Company's capital expenditure program, including store"
I7,"expansions and renovations, for working capital needs and for general corporate"
I7,purposes.
I7,
I7,The Company has a commercial paper program that allows borrowings up to a
I7,"maximum of $1 billion. As of January 28, 2001, there were $754 million of"
I7,"borrowings outstanding under the program. In connection with the program, the"
I7,Company has a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for up to $800
I7,"million. The credit facility, which expires in September 2004, contains various"
I7,"restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's"
I7,liquidity or capital resources.
I7,
I7,"As of January 28, 2001, the Company had $167 million in cash and cash"
I7,"equivalents. Management believes that its current cash position, internally"
I7,"generated funds, funds available from its $1 billion commercial paper program"
I7,and the ability to obtain alternate sources of financing should enable the
I7,"Company to complete its capital expenditure programs, including store openings"
I7,"and renovations, through the next several fiscal years."
I7,
I7,Although the Company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of
I7,"inflation on its operations, it does not believe inflation has had a material"
I7,effect on sales or results of operations.
I7,
I7,"In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of"
I7,"Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (""SFAS 133""), ""Accounting for Derivative"
I7,"Instruments and Hedging Activities."" SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be"
I7,carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
I7,derivatives must be recognized in the Company's statements of earnings when
I7,"they occur; however, there is an exception for derivatives that qualify as"
I7,"hedges as defined by SFAS 133. If a derivative qualifies as a hedge, a company"
I7,"can elect to use ""hedge accounting"" to eliminate or reduce the income statement"
I7,volatility that would arise from reporting changes in a derivative's fair
I7,"value. The Company will adopt SFAS 133 in the quarter ending April 29, 2001 and"
I7,will record its derivatives at fair value. Based on the Company's derivative
I7,"positions at January 28, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a"
I7,material impact on the Company's financial results.
I7,
I7,"In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued Staff"
I7,"Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (""SAB 101""), ""Revenue Recognition in Financial"
I7,"Statements."" SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC staff's views in applying"
I7,generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
I7,"statements. As of January 28, 2001, the Company was in compliance with SAB 101."
I7,
I7,"Certain statements we make in this report, and other written or oral statements"
I7,"made by or on behalf of the Company, may constitute ""forward-looking"
I7,"statements"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Words or phrases"
I7,"such as ""should result,"" ""are expected to,"" ""we anticipate,"" ""we estimate,"" ""we"
I7,"project,"" ""we believe,"" or similar expressions are intended to identify"
I7,forward-looking statements. Examples of such statements in this report include
I7,"descriptions of our plans with respect to new store openings and relocations,"
I7,our plans to enter new markets and expectations relating to our continuing
I7,growth. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that
I7,could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's historical
I7,experience and its present expectations or projections. Management believes
I7,"that these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not"
I7,place undue reliance on such statements. Such statements speak only as of the
I7,"date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise"
I7,"any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new"
I7,information or otherwise.
I7,
I7,The following are some of the factors that could cause the Company's actual
I7,results to differ materially from the expected results described in the
I7,Company's forward-looking statements:
I7,
I7,"-        Adverse or unanticipated weather conditions, which may affect the"
I7,Company's overall level of sales and sales of particular lines of
I7,"products, such as building materials, lumber and lawn and garden"
I7,supplies.
I7,
I7,"-        Instability of costs and availability of sourcing channels, which may"
I7,affect the prices that the Company pays for certain commodity
I7,"products, such as lumber and plywood, as well as the Company's ability"
I7,to improve its mix of merchandise. Our cost of sales is affected by
I7,our ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with
I7,our suppliers. Our sources of supply may be affected by trade
I7,"restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport costs and"
I7,"capacity, and other factors affecting domestic and international"
I7,markets.
I7,
I7,"-        Our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates"
I7,to staff both existing and new stores.
I7,
I7,"-        Conditions affecting the availability, acquisition, development and"
I7,"ownership of real estate, including local zoning and land use issues,"
I7,environmental regulations and general conditions in the commercial
I7,real estate market.
I7,
I7,"-        General economic conditions, which affect consumer confidence and home"
I7,"improvement and home-building spending, including interest rates, the"
I7,"overall level of economic activity, the availability of consumer"
I7,credit and mortgage financing and unemployment rates.
I7,
I7,"-        The impact of competition, including competition for customers,"
I7,locations and products and in other important aspects of our business.
I7,"Our primary competitors include electrical, plumbing and building"
I7,"materials supply houses, lumber yards, home improvement stores and"
I7,"other local, regional or national hardware stores, as well as discount"
I7,department stores and any other channel of distribution that offers
I7,"products that we sell. Our business is highly competitive, and we may"
I7,face new types of competitors as we enter new markets or lines of
I7,business.
I7,
I7,"-        Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting"
I7,"standards, tax statutes or regulations and environmental and land use"
I7,"regulations, and uncertainties of litigation."

I7A,
I7A,We use derivative financial instruments at various times to manage the risk
I7A,associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. These
