# scisbi - Scientific Machine Learning package for Simulation Based Inference

A personal project with multiple aims:

- Creating final project for my PhD course TTSSE (Techniques and Technologies for Scientific Software Engeneering) in Uppsala University
- Rewriting codes for existing simulation based inference methods and frameworks around them for gaining knowledge about current SOTA methods for further research
- Gaining experience in creating, developing and at least shortly maintaining OSS
