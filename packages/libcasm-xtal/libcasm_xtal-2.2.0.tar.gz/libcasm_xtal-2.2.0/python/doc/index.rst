libcasm-xtal
============

The libcasm-xtal package is the CASM crystallography module. This includes:

- Data structures for representing lattices, crystal structures, and
  degrees of freedom (DoF).
- Methods for enumerating superlattices, making superstructures,
  finding primitive and reduced cells, and finding symmetry
  operations.


About CASM
==========

The libcasm-xtal package is part of the CASM_ open source software package, which is designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
