#### libcasm-xtal

The libcasm-xtal package is the CASM crystallography module. This includes:

- Data structures for representing lattices, crystal structures, and
  degrees of freedom (DoF).
- Methods for enumerating superlattices, making superstructures, finding primitive and reduced cells, and finding symmetry operations.


#### Install

    pip install libcasm-xtal


#### Usage

See the [libcasm docs](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_pydocs/libcasm/overview/latest/).


#### About CASM
