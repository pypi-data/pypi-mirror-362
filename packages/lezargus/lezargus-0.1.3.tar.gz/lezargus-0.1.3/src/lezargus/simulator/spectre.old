    this way.

    By default, all attributes are public to allow for maximum transparency.
    By convention, please treat the attributes as read-only. Consult the
    documentation for changing them. By default, they are None, this allows
    us to track the process of the simulation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    astrophysical_object_spectra : LezargusSpectrum
        The "perfect" spectra of the astrophysical object who's observation is
        being modeled.
    astrophysical_object_cube : LezargusCube
        The cube form of the perfect astrophysical object who's observation is
        being modeled.

        emission after transmission.
    astrophysical_object_cube_atm_see : LezargusCube
        The astrophysical object after applying the atmospheric seeing
        convolution; after transmission and radiance.
    astrophysical_object_cube_atm_ref : LezargusCube
        The astrophysical object after applying the atmospheric refraction,
        after transmission, radiance, and seeing. This is actually just a
        read-only alias for :py:attr:`astronomical_object_cube`.
    astronomical_object_cube : LezargusCube
        The astronomical object, obtained from applying atmospheric conditions
        to the astrophysical object. Noted as "astronomical" as it is
        considered "as-observed" from the Earth ground.
