        #Today's Information and Ideas:
        Today's date is July 16, 2025. Today, on a whim, I started creating a Python module for our game engine called EYPO. EYPA will actually be the 2D EYPO Python module. A 3D Python module will also be released under a different name in the future. In the future, we can create similar modules for our two coding languages, EYC and RunScript.
        
        
        
        #Devlog of the Day: July 16, 2025:
        We added six functions. These are simple window functions, one button, and one simple property-changing function. Because I initially created a different, incorrect TextButtonID system, it took me a while to fix it later. But anyway, it turned out really well.
