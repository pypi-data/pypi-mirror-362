## Description

This is a python package I created in order to simplify the boiling process when asking the user a question via TTY or TUI (Terminal User Interface).

## Installation

### Using pip

```sh
pip install -U ask-question
```

### Using python

Under windows:

```bat
py -m pip install -U ask-question
```

Under Linux/Mac OS:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -U ask-question
```

## Usage

### Importing

```py
import ask_question as aq
```

### Initialising

The generic class is: `AskQuestion(human_type: dict = {}, illegal_characters_nb: str = "", tui: bool = False)`

```py
AQI = aq.AskQuestion()
```

### Calling the pause function

The generic function is:

```py
pause(self, pause_message: str = "Press enter to continue...")
```

The output is: None

```py
AQI.pause("Press enter to continue...")
```

### Asking a Question

The generic function to ask a question is:

```py
ask_question(self, question: str, answer_type: str)
```

The outputs of this functions can be:

* str   = a string
* int   = a whole number
* float = a floating number

#### Where do you live

```py
answer = AQI.ask_question("Where are you from? ", "str")
print(f"You live in {answer}!")
```

#### How old are you

```py
answer = AQI.ask_question("How old are you?", "uint")
ADD_S = ""
if answer > 1:
    ADD_S = "s"
print(f"You are {answer} year{ADD_S} old !")
```

#### Do you like sugar

```py
answer = AQI.ask_question("Do you like sugar? [(Y)es/(n)o]: ", "bool")
if answer == True:
    print("You like sugar !")
else:
    print("You do not like sugar.")
```

## Available boiling

Here are all the available boiling options and their explanation:

* int = whole number (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)
* float = floating number (-1.2, 0.1, 1.2, etc...)
* uint = whole positive number (0, 1, 2, etc...)
* ufloat = whole positive floating number (0.1, 1.2, etc ...)
* num = numeric (numbers from 0 onwards)
* alnum = alphanumeric (only numbers and the alphabet)
* alpha = alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)
* char = alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)
* ascii = ascii Table
* str = string (any character you can type)
* version = version (numbers separated by '.' characters)
* ver = version (numbers separated by '.' characters)
* bool = boolean (yes/True/1 or no/False/0 answer type)

## Change the initialisation content

When initialising the class it is possible to change the forbidden characters and/or the descriptions of the available types.

### changing the forbidden characters

```py
import ask_question as aq
illegal_characters = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c"
illegal_characters = illegal_characters.replace("0123456789","")
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(dict(), illegal_characters)
```

This initialisation has changed the characters that will be allowed for the number conversion in the 'int' and 'float' options.

### Changing the descriptions

```py
import ask_question as aq
human_type = {
    "int":"whole number (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)",
    "float":"floating number (-1.2, 0.1, 1.2, etc...)",
    "uint":"whole positive number (0, 1, 2, etc...)",
    "ufloat":"whole positive floating number (0.1, 1.2, etc ...)",
    "num":"numeric (numbers from 0 onwards)",
    "alnum":"alphanumeric (only numbers and the alphabet)",
    "alpha":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "char":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "ascii":"ascii Table",
    "str":"string (any character you can type)",
    "version":"version (numbers separated by '.' characters)",
    "ver":"version (numbers separated by '.' characters)",
    "bool":"boolean (yes/True/1 or no/False/0 answer type)",
}
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(human_type)
```

This initialisation has changed the descriptions for the types.
When the user will enter a wrong answer, the description displayed for the type you were expecting will be taken from the human_type dictionnary you have entered.

### Changing both

```py
import ask_question as aq
illegal_characters = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c"
illegal_characters = illegal_characters.replace("0123456789","")
human_type = {
    "int":"whole number (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)",
    "float":"floating number (-1.2, 0.1, 1.2, etc...)",
    "uint":"whole positive number (0, 1, 2, etc...)",
    "ufloat":"whole positive floating number (0.1, 1.2, etc ...)",
    "num":"numeric (numbers from 0 onwards)",
    "alnum":"alphanumeric (only numbers and the alphabet)",
    "alpha":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "char":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "ascii":"ascii Table",
    "str":"string (any character you can type)",
    "version":"version (numbers separated by '.' characters)",
    "ver":"version (numbers separated by '.' characters)",
    "bool":"boolean (yes/True/1 or no/False/0 answer type)",
}
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(human_type)
```

You have now impacted the int and float typing as well as the 'type' descriptions.

## Author

This module was written by (c) Henry Letellier
Attributions are appreciated.

Quick way (I assume you have already initialised the class):

```py
print(f"AskQuestion is written by {AQI.author}")
```

## Running unit tests

Although they might not be bundled in the module itself, you can clone the source repository, intall the requirement at the root and run `pytest -s` at the root of the repository to see the result.

## Note to the devs

Due to the update of the packaging methods (switching from setup.py to pyproject.toml) and for package stability tracking reasons, it is now required (or strongly suggested) you remove the resulting ask_question package that gets installed alongside with it's dependencies.

You can do so with the following command: `pip uninstall ask_question -y`
