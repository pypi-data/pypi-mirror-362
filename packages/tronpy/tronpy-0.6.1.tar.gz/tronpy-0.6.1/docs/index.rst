TronPy is an easy-to-use TRON HTTP API client. It supports most of the java-tron 4.1 APIs.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. The APIs may change often.

Key principles:

* Never use unsafe API (TronPy always sign offline)
* Always use base58check address (API response, ABI decode/encode, ...)
* Construct transactions offline (more control of ref_block, expiration)
