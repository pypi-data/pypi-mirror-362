# refrakt_cli

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/refrakt_cli.svg?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/refrakt_cli/)

**refrakt_cli** is a command-line interface for the [refrakt_core](https://github.com/refrakt-hub/refrakt_core) deep learning and machine learning research framework. It enables rapid, reproducible, and flexible pipeline training by converting CLI arguments into YAML-based experiment configurations, seamlessly integrating with refrakt_core's modular system.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install refrakt_cli
```

---

## 🚀 What is refrakt_cli?

- A CLI tool to launch, manage, and override ML/DL training pipelines using YAML configs.
- Bridges user-friendly command-line workflows with the powerful abstractions of refrakt_core.
- Supports dynamic hyperparameter overrides, modular experiment configs, and robust logging.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/refrakt-hub/refrakt_cli.git
cd refrakt_cli

# (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install .
```

---

## 🧪 Usage: Running Experiments

### Run with a config file

```bash
refrakt --config path/to/your_config.yaml
```

### Override hyperparameters on-the-fly

```bash
refrakt --config path/to/your_config.yaml model.name=ResNet optimizer.lr=0.0005 trainer.epochs=20
```

### Supported CLI Flags

| Flag         | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config`   | Path to YAML config file                                 |
| `--log_type` | Logging backend: `tensorboard`, `wandb`, or both         |
| `--debug`    | Enable debug mode with extra verbosity                   |
