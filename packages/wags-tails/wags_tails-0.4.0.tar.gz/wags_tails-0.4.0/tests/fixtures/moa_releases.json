Many of these changes are due to a recently discovered issue with DOIs pointing to journals published through Elsevier. \r\n- The NCT code was updated for Le et al. 2015 (PMID: 26028255)\r\n\r\nRemoved entries,\r\n- (Guideline) _BCR::ABL1_ and sensitivity to dasatinib, imatinib, and nilotinib in CML to reduce redundency from other CML guideline entries. \r\n- (Guideline) _BRAF_ p.V600E and sensitivity to dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in patients with NSCLC. This citation was incorrectly categorized as a Guideline as it references an FDA approval, which has since been added to the knowledge base.  \r\n- (Guideline) _BRCA1/2_ germline variants and sensitivity to pazopanib in ovarian cancer because the underlying source does not mention this relationship in the context of BRCA1/2. \r\n- (Guideline) _BRCA2_ germline variants and sensitivity to olaparib in ovarian cancer, as there was a duplicate record.\r\n- (Guideline) _KIT_ variants and poor prognosis in head and neck mucosal melanoma, as the citation suggests that head and neck mucosal melanoma has a poor prognosis independent of _KIT_ status.\r\n- (Guideline) _KRAS_, _PRFPF8_variants and poor prognosis in MDS. While KRAS is included in the IPSS-M Prognostic Risk Schema, KRAS being highlight as associated with poor prognosis is not explicitly stated in current guidelines. \r\n- (Guideline) _NRAS_, _SETBP1_, _TP53_ variants and poor prognosis in MDS has been removed as the current guidelines cite specific amino acid changes, which have been added.\r\n- (Clinical trial) _EGFR_ variants and sensitivity to Durvalumab + Gefitinib in NSCLC was removed [per further studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33012782/) observing a negative finding.\r\n- (Clinical trial) _KRAS_ p.G12C and sensitivity to AMG 510 was removed because there are now associated FDA approvals, and we will be phasing out abstracts from the knowledge base.\r\n- (Clinical evidence) _NRAS_ p.Q61L and sensitivity to Selumetinib in MDS was removed as it contained a duplicate record. \r\n- (Preclinical) _BRAF_ p.V600E and sensitivity to GANT61 was removed because the study findings were independent of melanoma cell line BRAF or NRAS status.\r\n"
