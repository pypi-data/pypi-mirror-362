## üöÄ Overview

Codebase Extractor is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to scan a project directory and consolidate all relevant source code into neatly organized Markdown files. It's perfect for creating a complete project snapshot for analysis, documentation, or providing context to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude.

The tool is highly configurable, allowing you to select specific folders, exclude large files, and intelligently ignore common directories like `node_modules` and `.git`.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive & User-Friendly:** A guided, multi-step CLI experience that makes selecting options simple and clear.
- **Smart Filtering:** Automatically excludes common dependency folders, build artifacts, version control directories, and IDE configuration files.
- **Flexible Selection Modes:** Choose to extract the entire project with one command, or dive into a specific selection mode.
- **üå≥ Nested Folder Selection:** Interactively browse and select specific sub-folders from a tree-like view.
- **üî¢ Configurable Scan Depth:** You decide how many levels deep the script should look for folders when building the selection tree.
- **YAML Metadata:** Each generated Markdown file is prepended with a YAML front matter block containing useful metadata like a unique run ID, timestamp, and file count for easy tracking and parsing.
- **üöÄ Quick Start Mode:** Use the `--no-instructions` flag to skip the detailed intro guide on subsequent runs.
- **Safe & Robust:** Features graceful exit handling (`Ctrl+C`) and provides clear feedback during the extraction process.

## üöÄ Installation

This guide will walk you through installing and running the Codebase Extractor.

### Step 1: Ensure Python is Installed

Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. You can check your version by opening your terminal and running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

The recommended way to install is directly from PyPI using pip, which comes with Python.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è For macOS & Linux Users

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install codebase-extractor
```

If you encounter a permission denied error, your system may require you to install it for your user account only:

```bash
pip3 install --user codebase-extractor
```

In this case, you may need to add the user script directory to your PATH. The installer will provide the necessary command if this is required.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è For Windows Users

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command:

```bash
pip install codebase-extractor
```

If the pip command is not found, you can try using the Python executable directly:

```bash
python -m pip install codebase-extractor
```

#### üí° Pro Tip: Using pipx

For a more advanced, isolated installation, we recommend using pipx. This ensures the tool's dependencies do not conflict with other Python projects on your system.

```bash
pipx install codebase-extractor
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Usage

Once installed, you can run the tool from any terminal window. Navigate to your project's root directory and run the command:

```bash
code-extractor
```

The script will then guide you through the extraction process.

## Quick Start

For repeat usage, you can skip the detailed introductory guide by using the `--no-instructions` or `-ni` flag:

```bash
code-extractor --no-instructions
```

### The Process

The tool will guide you through a series of prompts:

- **Initial Setup [1/2]**: A yes/no question to skip files larger than 1MB.
- **Extraction Mode [2/2]**: Choose whether to extract the entire project (`Everything`) or select specific folders.

### Specific Selection (if chosen):

- **Scan Depth**: You'll be asked how many sub-folder levels to scan for the selection list (defaults to 3).
- **Folder Tree**: You'll see a checklist of available folders and sub-folders to extract. The script handles selections intelligently:
  - Selecting a parent folder automatically includes all its sub-folders, so you don‚Äôt need to select them individually.
  - To extract only a sub-folder‚Äôs contents, select the sub-folder but not its parent.
  - The special `root [...]` option extracts only the files in your project's main directory, ignoring all sub-folders.

### Output Details

All output files are saved in a `CODEBASE_EXTRACTS` directory within your project folder. Each generated Markdown file includes a YAML metadata header with a unique reference ID, timestamp, and file count for easy tracking and parsing.
