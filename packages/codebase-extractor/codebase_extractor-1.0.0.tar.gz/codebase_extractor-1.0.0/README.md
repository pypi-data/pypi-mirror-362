## üöÄ Overview

Codebase Extractor is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to scan a project directory and consolidate all relevant source code into neatly organized Markdown files. It's perfect for creating a complete project snapshot for analysis, documentation, or providing context to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude.

The tool is highly configurable, allowing you to select specific folders, exclude large files, and intelligently ignore common directories like `node_modules` and `.git`.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive & User-Friendly:** A guided, multi-step CLI experience that makes selecting options simple and clear.
- **Smart Filtering:** Automatically excludes common dependency folders, build artifacts, version control directories, and IDE configuration files.
- **Flexible Selection Modes:** Choose to extract the entire project with one command, or dive into a specific selection mode.
- **üå≥ Nested Folder Selection:** Interactively browse and select specific sub-folders from a tree-like view.
- **üî¢ Configurable Scan Depth:** You decide how many levels deep the script should look for folders when building the selection tree.
- **YAML Metadata:** Each generated Markdown file is prepended with a YAML front matter block containing useful metadata like a unique run ID, timestamp, and file count for easy tracking and parsing.
- **üöÄ Quick Start Mode:** Use the `--no-instructions` flag to skip the detailed intro guide on subsequent runs.
- **Safe & Robust:** Features graceful exit handling (`Ctrl+C`) and provides clear feedback during the extraction process.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with Codebase Extractor, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lukaszlekowski/codebase-extractor.git](https://github.com/lukaszlekowski/codebase-extractor.git)
    cd codebase-extractor
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
    This keeps the dependencies for this project isolated from your system's Python installation.

    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    The required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Usage

Once installed, simply run the script from the root of the project you wish to extract:

```bash
python3 codebase_extractor.py
```

# Quick Start

For repeat usage, you can skip the detailed introductory guide by using the `--no-instructions` or `-ni` flag:

```bash
python3 codebase_extractor.py --no-instructions
```

## The Process

The tool will guide you through a series of prompts:

- **Initial Setup [1/2]**: A yes/no question to skip files larger than 1MB.
- **Extraction Mode [2/2]**: Choose whether to extract the entire project (`Everything`) or select specific folders.

### Specific Selection (if chosen):

- **Scan Depth**: You'll be asked how many sub-folder levels to scan for the selection list (defaults to 3).
- **Folder Tree**: You'll see a checklist of available folders and sub-folders to extract. The script handles selections intelligently:
  - Selecting a parent folder automatically includes all its sub-folders, so you don‚Äôt need to select them individually.
  - To extract only a sub-folder‚Äôs contents, select the sub-folder but not its parent.
  - The special `root [...]` option extracts only the files in your project's main directory, ignoring all sub-folders.

## Output Details

All output files are saved in a `CODEBASE_EXTRACTS` directory within your project folder. Each generated Markdown file includes a YAML metadata header with a unique reference ID, timestamp, and file count for easy tracking and parsing.
