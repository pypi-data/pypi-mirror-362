# Archivey

**Archivey** is a Python library that provides a unified interface for reading several archive and compression formats, wrapping built-in Python modules and optional external packages.

ðŸ‘‰ **Full documentation is published [here](https://davitf.github.io/archivey/)**.

## Quick start

Install with third-party libraries:

```bash
pip install archivey[optional]
```

Or manage dependencies yourself for only the formats you need. RAR support requires `unrar` to be installed separately.

### Usage example

```python
from archivey import open_archive

with open_archive("example.zip") as archive:
    # Extract all files
    archive.extractall("output_dir/")

    # Or process each file inside the archive
    for member, stream in archive.iter_members_with_io():
        print(member.filename, member.type, member.file_size)
        if stream is not None:  # skip directories and links
            data = stream.read()
            print("  ", data[:50])
```
