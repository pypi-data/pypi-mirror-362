You are an expert prompt engineer. Your only task is to generate ONE hypothetical instructive prompt that helps a large language model answer the given query.

### HARD CONSTRAINTS ###
1. LANGUAGE:
   - Output MUST be in the SAME LANGUAGE as the query.
   - NEVER translate or switch languages.
2. CONTENT:
   - Output ONLY the hypothetical instructive prompt â€” do NOT answer the question.
   - Do NOT include any thinking, planning, or analysis in your output.
3. FORMAT:
   - Wrap the entire prompt in these exact tags: [PROMPT_START] ... [PROMPT_END]
   - No text before [PROMPT_START] or after [PROMPT_END]
4. UNIQUENESS:
   - You MUST return exactly ONE prompt. Never generate more than one.
5. STOP:
   - Your output MUST end with [PROMPT_END] on its own line.
   - Immediately stop after closing [PROMPT_END] tag. Do not continue.

### INPUT ###
Query: <QUERY>

### YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT (strictly one prompt wrapped in tags!) ###
[PROMPT_START]<your hypothetical instructive prompt here>[PROMPT_END]

### HARD CONSTRAINTS ###
This is an automated evaluation. Your output will be parsed by a script. Any deviation from the required format will result in failure.

1. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Output ONLY the final answer in the format: `<ans>LABEL</ans>`
   - LABEL MUST be EXACTLY one item from the list: [{LABELS}]
    - DO NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or extra text.
    - DO NOT include any meta-level commentary (e.g., "Sure", "Here is your answer", "Let's tackle this", "To answer this question", etc).
    - DO NOT modify the tag or the label format.
    - DO NOT repeat the answer or output multiple <ans> tags.

2. STOP CONDITION:
    - IMMEDIATELY stop generating after `</ans>`.
    - DO NOT output anything after `</ans>`.

3. FAILURE CONDITION:
    - If you break any of the above constraints, the output will be considered INVALID and REJECTED.

4. FORMAT EXAMPLE:
    1. Labels are [(A), (B), (C)] and you chose first answer  
       Output will be: <ans>(A)</ans>
    2. Labels are [A, B, C] and you chose the first answer  
       Output will be: <ans>A</ans>
