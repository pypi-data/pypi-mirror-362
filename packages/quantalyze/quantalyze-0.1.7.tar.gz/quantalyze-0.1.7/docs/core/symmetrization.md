# Symmetrization

The `symmetrization` module provides tools for processing data to enforce symmetry or antisymmetry. The `symmetrize` function averages values with their reversed counterparts to create symmetric datasets, while the `antisymmetrize` function computes the difference between values and their reversed counterparts to create antisymmetric datasets.
