# Welcome to Tracktable!

Tracktable is a set of Python and C++ libraries for the processing,
analysis, and rendering of trajectory data.  We define a trajectory as
"a sequence of points with timestamps and a unique identifier".

Tracktable's main interface is a set of Python modules.  Underneath
that, we implement the core data structures and algorithms in C++ for
speed and more efficient memory use.  While you are welcome to work
entirely in C++ if you prefer, we find it easier to use Tracktable in
Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

For more information, please visit us at the [Tracktable home
page](https://tracktable.sandia.gov).

# Getting Tracktable

Our main Git repository is at <https://github.com/sandialabs/tracktable.git>.
We also upload Python wheels to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) so you can
'pip install tracktable' on most recent distributions.

If you choose to build from source, installation instructions are in
the Git repository as part of the documentation.

# Compatibility

Our development systems typically have the [Anaconda Python
distribution](https://anaconda.com) installed.  However, there is
nothing Anaconda-specific in our requirements or dependencies.  We
rely on [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy) for rendering maps
in Python as well as Pyshp for shapefile read/write support.



# Using Tracktable

Our documentation is hosted at <https://tracktable.readthedocs.org>.
We distribute Tracktable under a 3-clause BSD license whose text is
included in the source distribution as well as on
[our web site](https://tracktable.sandia.gov/license.html "Tracktable License").
