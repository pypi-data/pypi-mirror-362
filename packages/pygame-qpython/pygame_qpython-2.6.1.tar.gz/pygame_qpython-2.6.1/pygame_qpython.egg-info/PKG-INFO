This project is a branch of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pypi.org/project/pygame/">pygame</a> on <a href="https://www.qpython.org">QPython</a>.


**[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)** is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python.
It uses the [Simple DirectMedia Layer library](https://www.libsdl.org/) and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.

👉 **[We need your help](https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html)** to make pygame the best it can be! New contributors are welcome.

## Installation

Before installing pygame, you must check that Python is installed on your machine.

To find out, open a command prompt (Windows) or a terminal (MacOS/Linux) and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If a message such as `Python 3.8.10` appears, Python is correctly installed.
Otherwise, go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install it.

Next, check if `pip` is installed:

```bash
pip --version
```

If you see something like `pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/...`, you're ready to install pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Once installed, test pygame by running:

```bash
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```

If this doesn’t work, check the [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/) guide for platform-specific setup help.

## Help

If you're new to pygame, you should be able to get started fairly quickly.
Pygame comes with many tutorials and introductions. There's also full reference documentation.

You can browse documentation on the [docs page](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), or locally via:

```bash
python -m pygame.docs
```

If local docs aren't found, it will open the online documentation.

To upgrade pygame to the latest version:

```bash
pip install pygame --upgrade
```

Best of all, the `examples/` directory includes many playable programs to get you started.

## Building From Source

To use in-development features or contribute to Pygame, build it from source instead of installing via `pip`.

Installing from source is mostly automated. The most work is compiling dependencies. Once done, run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```
