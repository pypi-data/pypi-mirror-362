`spatiomic` is a computational library for the analysis of *spati*al prote*omic*s (with some functions also being useful for other *-omics*).

The main goal of this package is to organize different packages and methods that are commonly used when dealing with high-dimensional imaging data behind a single API that allows for scalable high-performance computing applications, whenever possible on the GPU.

## Installation

`spatiomic` is available through PyPi:

```bash
pip install spatiomic
```

For the best GPU-accelerated experience (optional), a CUDA-compatible GPU and installation of the `cupy`, `cuml`, `cuGraph` and `cuCIM` packages is necessary. Please consult the [RAPIDS.AI installation guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install) for further information.

Installation time should not exceed 5 minutes on a standard desktop computer with an average network connection.

## Documentation

Detailled documentation is made available at: [https://spatiomic.org](https://spatiomic.org).

The documentation also contains a small simulated dataset used for clustering, for more information, please refer to the `Pixel-based clustering` section of the documentation.

### Building the documentation

The documentation can be build locally by navigating to the `docs` folder and running: `make html`.
This requires that the development requirements of the package as well as the package itself have been installed in the same virtual environment and that `pandoc` has been added, e.g. by running `brew install pandoc` on macOS operating systems.

## System requirements

### Hardware requirements

`spatiomic` does not come with any specific hardware requirements. For an optimal experience and analysis of very large datasets, a CUDA-enabled GPU and sufficient RAM (e.g., >= 48 Gb) is recommended.

### Software requirements

#### Operating systems

Though it should run on all systems that can run Python, `spatiomic` has specifically been confirmed to work on the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ubuntu 24.04
- macOS Sequoia 15.1.1

#### Python version & dependencies

`spatiomic` requires Python version 3.10 or above (3.12 recommended).

#### Code editors

We recommend developers use Visual Studio Code with the recommended extensions and settings contained in the `.vscode` folder to edit this codebase.

### GPUs

The use of a GPU is optional but greatly accelerates many common `spatiomic` analyses. While most recent CUDA-compatible devices are expected to work, the following GPUs have been tested:

- NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada
- NVIDIA QUADRO RTX 8000
- NVIDIA V100

Using a modern computer (e.g., an M-series MacBook) without a CUDA-enabled GPU, the sample script provided in the `Full example` section of the documentation should take a few minutes, depending on your hardware, typically less than 3 minutes if all the data is already downloaded and the package is installed. With a CUDA-enabled GPU, it should be significantly faster.
