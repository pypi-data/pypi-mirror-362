    form so two lists can be compared.  The list is supplied and
    returned as a new list of IOS rules.  Note that it is not sorted in
    place), as parsed by _ip_acl_std_rule_parse().

    IPv4 standard ACLs are complicated in IOS due to its tendancy to
    reorganise the rules, after they're entered.  It always preserves
    the semantics of the list (never putting an overlapping 'permit' and
    'deny' in the wrong order), but it can move rules which don't
    interact around.  Presumably this is done to optimise processing.

    The solution adopted here is to build the ACLs up in blocks.  Each
    block is a set of rules where the address portions don't overlap;
    these are built, sorting each block into address order, before
    adding the sorted rules in the block into the resulting list.

    Note that this can result in 'permit' and 'deny' entries swapping
    order, as long as the addresses don't overlap.  For example, 'permit
    host 20.0.0.1', 'deny host 10.0.0.1' would be reversed into 'deny
    host 10.0.0.1', 'permit host 20.0.0.1' as the rules are organised
    into addresses order ('10.0.0.1' < '20.0.0.1').

    The result is lists which are not necessarily in the same order as
    they were constructed, nor how IOS stores them, but two lists should
    at least be in the same order so they can be directly compared.

    This function is applied to each list, after the configuration is
    read, and the returned list used to replace the order in which the
    rules were read.

    """This function compares two lists (typically an access-list or
    prefix-list) and returns the commands to create the new list but
    interspersed with comments that explain the differences.

    The 'indent' string is added to the start of every line (including
    the comments) and is typically set to a space character, for 'ip
    access-list ...', where the rules are in a subcontext, but left the
    empty string for things like 'ip prefix-list ...', where they are
    not.

    The 'prefix' is added after the indent, before the text of each
    line.  It is not included on lines with comments.  It would be set
    to the empty string for 'ip access-list ...' (where no extra string
    is required) or something like 'ip prefix-list NAME ', where this
    is required on the same line.  Note that it must contain a trailing
    space, if one is required, between it and the line.

    If either of the two lists supplied are None, an empty list is
    assumed, either removing or adding all the entries.

    The optional 'to_str_func' argument is used to convert list elements
    to strings, in advance of the comparison.  This is useful when the
    data in the lists is stored in a structured form (such as a tuple or
    dictionary).  The argument takes a function which is passed the
    element and must return a string.

    The return value is a list of lines these explaining comments
    inserted.  The lines without comments will create the new list.
