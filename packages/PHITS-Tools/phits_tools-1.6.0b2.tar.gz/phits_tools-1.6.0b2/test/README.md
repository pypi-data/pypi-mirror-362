# Testing instructions

The `test_PHITS_tools.py` script can be ran to test the correct functioning of 
the `PHITS Tools` module in parsing a variety of PHITS output files.
Owing to PHITS being export controlled and requring a state-issued license from 
the Japan Atomic Energy Agency or the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), 
no files distributed with PHITS are redistributed here.  That said, if you
already have a PHITS installation, you will find an extensive set of sample 
PHITS inputs and outputs provided within the `phits/sample/` and `phits/recommendation/`
directories and their nested subdirectories, totalling approximately 300 test 
output files to be parsed by this script.  Also note that the `phits/recommendation/` 
directory, complete with (approx. 50) PHITS output files, is publicly available for download on the PHITS website 
at the bottom of [this page under "Recommendation Settings"](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/rireki-manuale.html) 
([direct download of ZIP file here](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/lec/recommendation.zip)).

`test_PHITS_tools.py` uses these distributed sample outputs as its testing suite; 
all you must do is make sure the `path_to_phits_base_folder` variable on line 6 
correctly points to your PHITS installation's base folder (by default, `C:\phits\`). 
When the script is ran, `PHITS Tools` will attempt parsing all of these outputs and print 
its test results to the terminal and to `test.log`, saved to the current working directory.
